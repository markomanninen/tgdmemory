# Rate Limiting Implementation Report

## Summary

Rate limiting has been successfully implemented in the TGD Memory application to protect against potential abuse or excessive requests. The implementation includes two tiers of rate limiting:

1. **General API Rate Limiting**: Applied to all `/api/*` routes with moderate limits
2. **Authentication Rate Limiting**: Applied to auth endpoints with stricter limits

The rate limiting is properly configured to work in a Docker container environment with Nginx as a reverse proxy, including correct handling of client IP identification via proxy headers.

## Implementation Details

### Express Rate Limiting Middleware

- Added `express-rate-limit` package to the server dependencies
- Configured `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` to ensure correct client IP detection behind a proxy
- Implemented two rate limiters:
  - `apiLimiter` with limits of 100 requests per 15 minutes in production
  - `authLimiter` with limits of 5 requests per 15 minutes in production

### Proxy Header Handling

- Configured Express to trust the `X-Forwarded-For` header from the Nginx reverse proxy
- Verified that Nginx is correctly passing client IP information in headers

### Testing

A comprehensive test script was created (`test_rate_limiting.sh`) to verify:
- API endpoint rate limiting functionality
- Authentication endpoint rate limiting functionality
- Proper handling of proxy headers

Tests were conducted in the Docker container environment to ensure everything works as expected in production conditions.

## Documentation

The rate limiting implementation has been documented in:
- A new dedicated document: `docs/RATE_LIMITING.md`
- Updates to the main `README.md` file
- Addition to the `ADMIN_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` guide

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**: Consider implementing monitoring for rate limit hits to detect potential attacks
2. **Distributed Rate Limiting**: If scaling to multiple instances, consider using a Redis store for rate limiting instead of the default memory store
3. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust the rate limit values based on actual usage patterns after observing the application in production

## Conclusion

The rate limiting implementation provides robust protection against abuse while maintaining normal functionality for legitimate users. The configuration is adaptable to different environments (development vs. production) and includes proper handling of proxy headers for accurate client IP identification.
