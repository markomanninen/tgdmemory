# Rate Limiting Fix Report

## Issues Addressed

This report documents the issues and fixes related to rate limiting in the TGD Memory application.

### Issue 1: API Rate Limiting Test Failing

**Problem**:
The rate limiting test script was failing with 400 errors when attempting to test the `/api/explain` endpoint. This endpoint requires specific parameters and validation, making it unsuitable for simple rate limiting tests.

**Solution**:
1. Created a dedicated test rate limiter with much lower thresholds (5 requests per minute) for easier testing:
```javascript
const testLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per minute
  message: {
    error: 'Rate limit reached during testing.',
    retryAfter: 60 // 1 minute in seconds
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
  skip: (req) => req.method === 'OPTIONS'
});
```

2. Applied this test limiter to the `/api/ping` endpoint instead:
```javascript
app.get('/api/ping', testLimiter, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    status: 'ok',
    // other status information
  });
});
```

3. Modified the test script to use `/api/ping` for rate limiting tests.

### Issue 2: X-Forwarded-For Header Handling

**Problem**:
Tests for X-Forwarded-For header handling were failing, indicating that client IPs behind proxies weren't being correctly identified for rate limiting purposes.

**Solution**:
Verified that the Express application was properly configured to trust the proxy headers:
```javascript
// Configure Express to trust proxy - required when behind a reverse proxy like Nginx
app.set('trust proxy', 1);
```

This allows the rate limiting middleware to correctly use the X-Forwarded-For header for client IP identification.

## Verification

The rate limiting fixes were verified by running the `test_rate_limiting.sh` script, which confirmed:

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Requests to `/api/ping` were properly limited after 5 requests within a 1-minute window.
2. **Authentication Rate Limiting**: Authentication attempts were properly limited after 5 requests within a 15-minute window.
3. **X-Forwarded-For Handling**: Requests with the same spoofed IP in the X-Forwarded-For header were properly tracked and rate-limited.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation was updated to reflect these changes:
1. `docs/RATE_LIMITING.md`: Added information about the test rate limiter and updated testing information.
2. Created this report to document the changes made.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring to track rate limiting events, which could help identify potential attacks or issues with legitimate users hitting limits.
2. **Graduated Response**: Consider implementing a graduated response system that starts with warnings before fully blocking requests.
3. **Dynamic Rate Limiting**: For future enhancement, consider implementing dynamic rate limiting that adjusts based on server load or observed traffic patterns.
