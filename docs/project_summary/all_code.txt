{"explanation":"<h3>Symbol Meanings</h3>\n<p>\nIn the equation $D(CP_2) = \\Gamma^k D_k$, the symbols are as follows:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>$D(CP_2)$</b>: The Dirac operator defined on the complex projective plane $CP_2$.</li>\n  <li><b>$\\Gamma^k$</b>: Gamma matrices (or Dirac matrices) associated with the Clifford algebra, acting on spinor fields.</li>\n  <li><b>$D_k$</b>: Covariant derivatives along the coordinate directions labeled by index $k$ on $CP_2$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Conceptual Significance</h3>\n<p>\nThis equation expresses the Dirac operator on $CP_2$ as a combination of gamma matrices and covariant derivatives. It encapsulates how spinor fields are differentiated in a curved, complex manifold setting, incorporating both geometric and algebraic structures. The gamma matrices encode the spinor representation of the Clifford algebra, ensuring the operator acts correctly on spinor fields respecting the manifold's geometry.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in CP2 Dirac Operator</h3>\n<p>\nIn the context of $CP_2$, a complex 2-dimensional projective space, the Dirac operator plays a crucial role in analyzing fermionic fields and their dynamics. It generalizes the flat-space Dirac operator to curved space, incorporating the manifold's metric and spin connection. Equation 4 succinctly captures this by expressing the operator as a sum over gamma matrices and covariant derivatives, which together account for the curvature and complex structure of $CP_2$.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nSuppose we have a spinor field $\\psi$ on $CP_2$. Applying the Dirac operator, we get:\n</p>\n$$\nD(CP_2) \\psi = \\Gamma^k D_k \\psi,\n$$\nwhere each $D_k \\psi$ involves derivatives of $\\psi$ along the coordinate directions, adjusted for curvature and connection. The gamma matrices then combine these derivatives into a single operator that respects the spinor structure, enabling analysis of fermionic behavior on $CP_2$.\n</p>"}

{"explanation":"<h3>Symbol Meanings</h3>\n<p>\nIn the equation, $p^2$ represents the squared momentum of a particle or system, while $\\Lambda_n^2$ denotes the quantized squared mass associated with the $n$-th energy level or state. The subscript $n$ indicates that these values are discrete and depend on the quantum number $n$.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Conceptual Significance</h3>\n<p>\nThis equation expresses a fundamental relationship in mass quantization, where the squared momentum $p^2$ is directly equal to a discrete mass squared $\\Lambda_n^2$. It highlights that, unlike classical physics where mass can vary continuously, in certain quantum systems, mass (or related quantities like energy and momentum) takes on specific, quantized values. This quantization leads to discrete energy levels and mass states.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in Mass Quantization</h3>\n<p>\nWithin the framework of mass quantization, this equation signifies that the mass spectrum of the system is not continuous but consists of distinct levels characterized by the quantum number $n$. It often appears in theories involving extra dimensions, quantum gravity, or particle models where mass arises from underlying quantized modes. The relation helps in understanding how mass emerges from fundamental quantized parameters of the system.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nSuppose for a particular system, the quantized mass squared levels are given by $\\Lambda_1^2 = (100\\, \\text{MeV})^2$ and $\\Lambda_2^2 = (200\\, \\text{MeV})^2$. Then, the allowed squared momenta for these states are $p^2 = (100\\, \\text{MeV})^2$ for $n=1$, and $p^2 = (200\\, \\text{MeV})^2$ for $n=2$, illustrating how the momentum values are discretized according to the mass quantization condition.\n</p>"}

It combines gamma matrices with momentum operators to form a first-order differential operator that acts on spinor fields. This operator encapsulates the relativistic behavior of fermions, such as electrons, and is fundamental in formulating the Dirac equation, which describes particles with spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ in quantum field theory.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in M4 Dirac Operator</h3>\n<p>\nWithin the context of the $M^4$ Dirac operator, this expression represents the core differential operator that governs the dynamics of spinor fields in four-dimensional spacetime. It generalizes the concept of the gradient to include spinor structure, ensuring Lorentz invariance and incorporating relativistic effects. The full Dirac equation involves this operator acting on a spinor field $\\psi$, typically written as $D(M^4)\\psi = m \\psi$, where $m$ is the particle's mass.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nFor a free particle, the Dirac equation can be written as:\n$$\n(\\gamma^k p_k - m) \\psi = 0,\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the particle's mass.

{"explanation":"<h3>Symbol Meanings</h3>\n<p>\nIn the equation, $D$ represents the Dirac operator, a fundamental differential operator acting on spinor fields in geometric and physical contexts. The terms $D(M^4)$ and $D(CP_2)$ denote the Dirac operators associated with specific manifolds: $M^4$ is a four-dimensional manifold, and $CP_2$ is the complex projective plane, a two-dimensional complex manifold. The sum indicates a combined operator acting on a product space or a composite system involving these two geometries.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Conceptual Significance</h3>\n<p>\nThis equation expresses the idea that the overall Dirac operator $D$ can be decomposed into contributions from different geometric components, namely $M^4$ and $CP_2$. It reflects how the properties of spinor fields and fermionic operators are influenced by the underlying geometry. Such a decomposition is crucial in understanding how complex spaces can be analyzed by studying their simpler constituent parts, especially in contexts like noncommutative geometry or string theory.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in Dirac Operator Sum</h3>\n<p>\nIn the broader framework, the Dirac operator sum signifies a construction where the total operator on a product space is built from the individual operators on each factor. This approach allows physicists and mathematicians to analyze the spectral properties, index theory, and geometric features of complex manifolds by considering their components separately. It is particularly useful in models where spacetime is modeled as a product of different geometric or topological spaces, each contributing to the overall behavior of fermionic fields.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nSuppose $M^4$ is a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, and $CP_2$ is a compact complex surface.

# TGD Memory Project - Equation Explanation System

This document explains how to set up and use the equation explanation functionality in the TGD Memory project.

## Overview

The equation explanation system allows readers to click on equations in the document and receive detailed explanations of the mathematics. The system:

1. Displays equations without equation numbers in the modal
2. Shows the equation with a descriptive title
3. Fetches an explanation from either:
   - A local cache file
   - A primary API (OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano-based)
   - A fallback API (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-based)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend Server

The backend server handles explanation generation and caching. To set it up:

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Edit the .env file to add your API keys and configure models
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-nano    # New default: using the fast nano model
# GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20   # Recommended: latest Gemini model
# MAX_TOKENS=1500           # Set the maximum output length
# TEMPERATURE=0.2           # Control randomness (0.0-1.0)

# Start the server in development mode
npm run dev
```

The server will run on http://localhost:3000 with the following endpoints:
- `/api/explain` - Primary API using OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano
- `/api/explain-with-gemini` - Fallback API using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

### 2. Test the System

1. Ensure the server is running
2. Open one of the HTML pages with equations
3. Click on an equation's explanation icon
4. The modal should display the equation and fetch an explanation

## How it Works

1. **Frontend (`globalEquationExplainer.js`):**
   - Detects clicks on equation trigger elements
   - Shows a modal with the unnumbered equation
   - Fetches explanations through a multi-step process
   - Handles caching for improved performance

2. **Backend (`server.js` and integration modules):**
   - Provides API endpoints for generating explanations
   - Uses LLM services to create detailed explanations
   - Caches results for future requests

## Adding Explainable Equations

To make an equation explainable:

1. Wrap it in a container with the class `explainable-equation-container`
2. Add the `data-latex-equation` attribute with the LaTeX content
3. Add a descriptive `title` attribute
4. Include a trigger element with class `equation-explainer-trigger`

Example:

```html
<div class="explainable-equation-container" 
     data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \end{equation}"
     title="Energy-Mass Equivalence">
  
  <!-- Equation content rendered by MathJax -->
  
  <button class="equation-explainer-trigger">
    <span>Explain</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No explanation appears**: Check that the server is running and API keys are set
- **Equation numbers still showing in modal**: Check the LaTeX transformation logic
- **Cache not working**: Ensure the cache directories exist and are writable

## Managing the Cache

The system caches explanations in two locations:
- Server cache: `/server/explanations-cache/`
- Public cache: `/public/explanations-cache/`

To clear all cached explanations (useful during development or to force regeneration):

```bash
# From project root
npm run clean-caches

# Or from server directory
cd server
npm run clean
```

This will remove all cached explanations, and new ones will be generated on demand.

## Credits

- Frontend equation handling uses MathJax
- Explanations generated with OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash APIs
- Both models are optimized for fast, efficient explanations with high quality

# TGD Memory Project

A project for exploring Topological Geometrodynamics (TGD) models of memory, featuring interactive presentations and equation explanations.

## Features

- Interactive presentations on TGD models of memory
- Equation explanation system that provides detailed explanations of mathematical formulas
- Academic papers in HTML format with LaTeX equation support
- Mobile-responsive design

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tgdmemory.git
cd tgdmemory

# Run the initialization script
./init.sh

# Start both the main app and equation server
npm run dev:all
```

Visit http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to see the project.

## Documentation

- [Getting Started Guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md) - Basic setup and usage
- [Equation Explanation System](./EQUATION_EXPLANATION.md) - Detailed information about the equation explanation system

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Main source code for the presentation
- `/src/pages/dirac_propagator` - HTML files for the Dirac propagator paper
- `/src/assets/js` - JavaScript files, including the equation explainer
- `/server` - Backend server for generating equation explanations

## Equation Explanation System

The project includes a system for explaining mathematical equations:

1. Click on an equation in the document to see its detailed explanation
2. The system fetches explanations from a local cache or generates them using AI
3. Explanations include step-by-step breakdowns of the mathematics

The system uses:
- OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano as the primary explanation engine
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash as a fallback option

To use the equation explainer, make sure the server is running:

```bash
npm run start-equation-server
```

To test the AI models:

```bash
# Test OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano
cd server && npm run test:openai-nano

# Test Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
cd server && npm run test:gemini-flash
```

# Getting Started with TGD Memory Project

This guide will help you set up and run the TGD Memory project, including the equation explanation system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tgdmemory.git
   cd tgdmemory
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the main project:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the equation explanation server:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-equation-server
   ```

4. Edit API keys in the server's `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cd server
   nano .env  # or use any text editor
   ```
   
   Add your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Project

### Option 1: Start everything at once

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will start both the main Vite server and the equation explanation server concurrently.

### Option 2: Start components separately

1. Start the main Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the equation explanation server:
   ```bash
   npm run start-equation-server
   ```

## Testing

Test the equation explanation server:
```bash
npm run test-equation-server
```

## Accessing the Project

- Main website: http://localhost:5173/
- Equation explanation server: http://localhost:3000/

                <p>In this article the notion of fermion propagator is discussed. It is found that the construction is much more than a mere computational challenge. There are two alternative approaches. Fermionic propagation could correspond to a) a 4-D or lower-dimensional propagation at the space-time level for the induced spinor fields as analog of massless propagation or b) to 8-D propagation in H between points belonging to the space-time surface.</p>
                <p>For the option b) the separate conservations of baryon and lepton number requires fixed H-chirality so that the spinor mode is sum of products of M<sup>4</sup> and CP<sub>2</sub> spinors with fixed M<sup>4</sup> and CP<sub>2</sub> chiralities whose product is +1 or -1. This implies that M<sup>4</sup> propagation is massless. The Euclidean signature of CP<sub>2</sub> in turn suggests that there is no propagation in CP<sub>2</sub> and the CP<sub>2</sub> projections s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub> for the ends of the propagator line are the same. This allows a very simple form for the matrix elements of the propagator and the condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> implies that the propagation from s<sub>1</sub> is possible to a discrete set of points s<sub>2</sub>. This has direct relevance for the understanding of color confinement and more or less implies the intuitively deduced TGD based model for elementary particles.</p>
                <p>Although the option a) need not provide a realistic propagator, it could provide a very useful semiclassical picture. If the condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> is assumed, fermionic propagation along light-like geodesics of H is favored and in accordance with the model for elementary particles. This allows a classical space-time picture of particle massivation by p-adic thermodynamics and color confinement.</p>
                <p>Also the interpretational and technical problems related to the construction of 4-D variants of super-conformal representations having spinor modes as ground states and to the p-adic thermodynamics are discussed.</p>

                <p>In this article the identification and calculation of the fermion propagator S<sub>F</sub>(h<sub>1</sub>,h<sub>2</sub>) in H=M<sup>4</sup>×CP<sub>2</sub> is discussed in detail. Also the definition of fermion propagator at space-time surface is considered.</p>
            
                <h3 id="basic-questions" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">1.1 Basic questions</h3>
                <p>Let us summarize the basic physical picture first. The following picture is only one of the many variants and must of course be taken with reservations.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The TGD view of fundamental interactions <a href="#ref-btart-TGD2024I">[TGD2024I, TGD2024II (btart)]</a> differs from that of the standard model. The notion of color differs from that of QCD and electroweak gauge potentials correspond to the components of the induced spinor connection of CP<sub>2</sub> <a href="#ref-allb-tgdnewphys">[tgdnewphys1, tgdnnewphys2 (allb)]</a>. A strong correlation between mass, color quantum numbers and electroweak quantum numbers at the fundamental level corresponding to space-time surfaces is predicted <a href="#ref-btart-isospinbreak">[isospinbreak (btart)]</a>. The standard view emerges as an approximation at the QFT limit.</li>
                    <li>In CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom, well-defined H chirality implies that the H propagator D<sub>F</sub>((m<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>1</sub>),(m<sub>2</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>)) is reduced to a bilocal inner product for the two modes with the same CP<sub>2</sub> chirality defined by the propagator factor associated with the propagator. An important constraint is that the end points are restricted to the space-time surface. If the propagator reduces to the delta function in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom, as the Euclidean metric suggests, one has s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> with very powerful consequences. Second important point is that in M<sup>4</sup> the propagation is between identical M<sup>4</sup> chiralities by the separate conservation of lepton and quark quantum numbers.</li>
                    <li>What does one mean with a virtual fermion now? Propagation in H is the natural geometric definition for virtuality. The first naive guess was that the virtual fermions correspond to masses p<sup>2</sup>=Λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>, Λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> is the eigenvalue of the CP<sub>2</sub> Dirac operator, as predicted by the H Dirac equation in H.
                    This however leads to a conclusion that the propagator does not have these masses as poles unless the normalization of the mass shell states is such that poles are there. Furthermore, these masses do not correspond to the masses of physical fermion, which are generated by p-adic thermodynamics. This picture looks therefore unphysical.</li>
                    <li>The condition that quark and lepton numbers are separately conserved forces us to assume a fixed H-chirality so that fermions are massless in 8-D sense. This implies that the spinor modes are superpositions of modes for which M<sup>4</sup> chirality and CP<sub>2</sub> chirality are well-defined and either the same or opposite depending on whether quark or lepton is in question. Fixed M<sup>4</sup> chirality requires a massless propagation in M<sup>4</sup>. This is a rather dramatic prediction and means that propagation completely separates from the properties and construction of states.
                    CP<sub>2</sub> has Euclidean signature of metric, which suggests that propagation is not possible at all. The propagator would reduce to a delta function in CP<sub>2</sub>: the end points s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub> would be identical for CP<sub>2</sub> propagation. A second dramatic prediction is that, the condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> allows for a fixed point s<sub>1</sub> only a discrete set of final points.</li>
                    <li>The propagation in H is analog of off-mass shell propagation as off-space-time surface propagation. The notion of induced spinor structure however suggests that it might make sense to speak of propagation along the space-time surface as analog of on-mass-shell propagation.
                    The induced Dirac equation in X<sup>4</sup> is analogous to the massless Dirac equation. The condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> however suggests that this propagation is along light-like geodesics of H, whose projection is a geodesic circle of CP<sub>2</sub>. This would give a classical geometric correlate for the fermion propagation even if the space-time propagator might not be needed.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <h4 id="how-physical-color" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.1 How do the physical color quantum numbers emerge?</h4>
                <p>It must be taken into account that physical fermions are either color singlets or triplets, not arbitrarily high color partial waves satisfying only the triality condition t=1 for quarks and t=0 for leptons.</p>
                <p>This is achieved in two ways.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>Neutrino-antineutrino ν<sub>L</sub>ν̅<sub>R</sub> pair screens the electroweak charges above weak boson Compton length and could also screen the anomalous parts of color charges.</li>
                    <li>The solutions Dirac equation are ground states of conformal representations in which the action of a conformal scaling generator generates higher excitations, which can have color quantum numbers which add to those of color partial waves to give rise to color singlets and triplets.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>p-Adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> describes the thermodynamics of the scaling generator, and gives excellent predictions for the particle masses so that conformal algebra is involved in any case.</p>
                <p>For the proposed form of the H propagator, the construction of the quantum states separates completely from that for the propagator.</p>
            
                <h4 id="confinement-scale" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.2 How could the confinement scale emerge?</h4>
                <p>In QCD, confinement occurring on some M<sup>4</sup> scale, the confinement scale, is a fundamental concept. Free quarks are the basic dynamical entities below the confinement scale and transform to hadrons above this scale.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>In attempts to understand this, the space-time representation of H propagator D<sub>F</sub>((m<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>1</sub>),(m<sub>2</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>)) for the massa propagator M<sup>4</sup> degrees of freedom should be used (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Propagator</a>).
                    One can consider two options depending on whether the propagation occurs in H or in X<sup>4</sup>. What is expected to happen in the case of H propagation, is the following.
                        <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                            <li>At least in short scales when a<sup>2</sup>=(m<sub>1</sub>-m<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> (a is Minkowski distance is small enough, the propagator is essentially a delta function δ(s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>) in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom. This would be a phase where the quarks are free and effectively massless. What is remarkable is that the s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> condition implies that for a given s<sub>1</sub> there is only a discrete set of points that the propagator can connect! At partonic orbits for which CP<sub>2</sub> projection is fixed the number of these points would be large.</li>
                            <li>If the condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> holds true quite generally, the classical non-determinism of the space-time dynamics implies that the number of points satisfying these conditions is reduced during the time evolution and makes propagation impossible for large values of a<sup>2</sup>. This would mean quark confinement. This of course also applies to possible colored excitations of leptons predicted by TGD and for which there is some evidence <a href="#ref-allb-leptc">[leptc (allb)]</a>.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>It is reasonable to expect that the p-adic length scale determines the scale at which the confinement occurs. This is where the algebraic geometry of the spacetime surface comes into play.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here holography=holomorphy vision suggests a concrete approach.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>In the holography=holomorphy vision <a href="#ref-btart-Frenkel">[Frenkel, Langlands2025 (btart)]</a>, space-time surfaces corresponds to the roots of polynomial pair f=(f<sub>1</sub>,f<sub>2</sub>): H→C<sup>2</sup> of generalized complex coordinates of H (one hypercomplex coordinate and 3 complex coordinates). They allow as dynamic symmetries the maps g=(g<sub>1</sub>,g<sub>2</sub>): C<sup>2</sup>→C<sup>2</sup> defined as functional compositions f→g∘f.
                    One can define prime polynomial pairs f as those which do not allow a decomposition f=g∘h. The prime polynomial pairs g=(g<sub>1</sub>,g<sub>2</sub>) can be defined similarly. The pairs (g<sub>1</sub>,Id) are of special interest and in this case the prime polynomials g<sub>1</sub>(p) have prime degree p.</li>
                    <li>One should study the H propagator D<sub>F</sub>((m<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>1</sub>),(m<sub>2</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>)) for the polynomials g<sub>p</sub> and the functional iterates g<sub>p</sub><sup>∘k</sup>∘f. The integration over CP<sub>2</sub> projections of the end points gives a bilocal inner product of the modes. The constraint s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> reduces it to an ordinary inner product for the CP<sub>2</sub> spinor modes.
                    The number of point pairs satisfying the constraint s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> depends on the space-time surface. The functional iterates of g<sub>p</sub> involve classical non-determinism identifiable as p-adic non-determinism <a href="#ref-btart-HHtwistor">[HHtwistor (btart)]</a> so that the number space-time points satisfying the constraint s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> decreases as the number k of iteration steps increases. This would make propagation over too long scales impossible. p-Adic length scale could correspond to this scale. Note that very large primes p are involved: for the electron one has p=M<sub>127</sub>=2<sup>127</sup>-1.
                    The confinement scale can be identified as a p-adic length scale for quarks or hadrons, which is determined by the thermal mass predicted by p-adic thermodynamics. The larger the value of p, the longer the confinement scale.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Concerning the option based on X<sup>4</sup> propagation two observations can be made.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The possibly existing X<sup>4</sup> propagator would be the analog of a massless propagator since the Dirac equation for induced spinor fields in X<sup>4</sup> is a generalization of the massless Dirac equation. This notion makes sense also for the lower dimensional surfaces of X<sup>4</sup> and 1-D light-like curves are natural candidates for fermion lines.</li>
                    <li>An observation of possible relevance is that the masses of quarks are effectively zero for the propagation along the light-like M<sup>4</sup> geodesics along parton surfaces.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <h4 id="effective-mass-scale" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.3 How the effective mass scale of a fermion is determined?</h4>
                <p>There are two basic questions to be answered. Is the p-adic mass scale determined by the spectrum of CP<sub>2</sub> masses or by p-adic thermodynamics? Does the spectrum of CP<sub>2</sub> masses or p-adic thermal masses appear at the level of propagator or only at the level of initial and final states of propagation?</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>A naive assumption would be that the quark and lepton masses appear in the propagator depend on the spectrum of color excitations m<sup>2</sup>=λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> for the fermions involved (ν<sub>L</sub>ν̅<sub>R</sub> for the second option). Several arguments suggest this cannot be the case.
                    p-Adic thermodynamics, in which the basic parameters characterizing the particle are the p-adic prime p and the p-adic temperature T<sub>p</sub>=1/n, works excellently so that it seems that CP<sub>2</sub> mass spectrum does not make itself visible in the propagator. In p-adic thermodynamics, a large p ≈ 2<sup>k</sup>, simplifies enormously and something similar can be expected now as well.</li>
                    <li>If the propagation takes in H, it is massless for a fixed H chirality so that the eigenvalue spectrum of D(CP<sub>2</sub>) is not visible in propagation. This separation between the structure of states and propagator would be a huge simplification.</li>
                    <li>Concerning X<sup>4</sup> propagation, the semiclassical description as light-like H geodesics of the geodesic manifold M<sup>4</sup>×S<sup>1</sup>⊂ M<sup>4</sup>×CP<sub>2</sub> could be considered as a model. The masslessness of H would no longer imply masslessness in M<sup>4</sup>. One could say that p-adic thermal excitations deform the light-like geodesics of M<sup>4</sup> to those of M<sup>4</sup>×S<sup>1</sup>⊂ H. Also this suggests that the masses are not visible in the X<sup>4</sup> propagator as also the fact that they do not appear in the X<sup>4</sup> Dirac operator suggests.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <h3 id="plan-of-article" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">1.2 Plan of the article</h3>
                <p>The plan of the article is as follows.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>I have considered several approaches to the calculation of the fermion propagator and in the following I describe the most elegant looking view about the fermion propagation as propagation in H. Assuming a fixed H chirality, the propagator reduces to massless propagator in H and is proportional to delta function in CP<sub>2</sub> so that no propagation occurs in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom. This has powerful consequences and the existing intuitive picture about fundamental fermion lines as light-like geodesics at partonic 2-surfaces follows. One can also understand color confinement in this picture.</li>
                    <li>The 4-D propagation along X<sup>4</sup> involves induced spinor structure and my intuitive feeling is that also this perspective is important, at least as semiclassical model. The condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> for H propagation suggests that fermion propagation is always 1-dimensional and along a light-like geodesic of H. This would give a very concrete classical view of the propagation even if a 4-D propagator were not useful. In particular, the p-adic thermal massivation could be modelled semi-classically.</li>
                    <li>Also the problems related to the origin of p-adicity and interpretational problems of p-adic thermodynamics and to the generalized conformal invariance will be discussed in the Appendix.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="how-propagation-takes-place" class="mb-12 scroll-mt-custom">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">2. How does the propagation take place?</h2>
                <p>I have considered two alternative views concerning what fermion propagation could mean.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>Fermions propagate along the 4-D space-time surface X<sup>4</sup> as induced spinor fields and the propagator is defined by the analog of 4-D massless Dirac operator.</li>
                    <li>Fermions propagate in H and virtuality in geometric sense could mean that they can leave the space-time surface during the propagation. Off mass-shell property would mean off-space-time surface.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Could the two interpretations for the fermion propagation be consistent? The space-time propagation as a 4-D propagation is geometrically much more restricted. Could the propagator code for the information about initial and final quantum states as a kind of quantum-classical correspondence?</p>

                <h3 id="leptons-quarks-quantized" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">2.1 Leptons and quarks as quantized free spinor fields in H</h3>
                <p>It is good to start with the description of H spinor fields and of the H Dirac equation. This topic is also discussed in Appendix A.</p>

                <h4 id="leptons-quarks-h-spinors" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.1.1 Leptons and quarks as H spinors with different H chiralities</h4>
                <p>Consider first the general theory.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The second quantized spinor field in H=M<sup>4</sup>×CP<sub>2</sub> can be written as superpositions of modes multiplied with a creation or annihilation operator.</li>
                    <li>Suppose that the spinor fields of H have a definite H-chirality so that they are either leptonic or quark-like, not a superposition of the two: this would violate the superselection rule of charge and fermion number.
                    One has
                    <p class="equation">Γ<sub>9</sub>Ψ<sub>ε</sub> = ε Ψ<sub>ε</sub> .</p>
                    ε =+1/-1 is the H-chirality and quarks and leptons have opposite chiralities.</li>
                    <li>The Dirac equation is satisfied by the spinor modes of H. They are massless in H but not in M<sup>4</sup>(!). This is essential for the twistorization and the divergence-free nature of the theory.
                    The Dirac operator is
                    <p class="equation">D = D(M<sup>4</sup>) + D(CP<sub>2</sub>),</p>
                    where
                    <p class="equation">D(M<sup>4</sup>) = γ<sup>k</sup>p<sub>k</sub></p>
                    is the Dirac operator in M<sup>4</sup> and
                    <p class="equation">D(CP<sub>2</sub>) = Γ<sup>k</sup>D<sub>k</sub> .</p>
                    is the Dirac operator in CP<sub>2</sub>. Here D<sub>k</sub> is covariant derivative, which is defined by the spinor connection of CP<sub>2</sub> that encodes electroweak interactions. The Kähler gauge potential A<sub>k</sub> for leptons is 3A<sub>k</sub> and for quarks A<sub>k</sub>. This explains the different electric charges of quarks and leptons.
                    Twistorialization suggests that M<sup>4</sup> allows the analog of Kähler structure whereas vielbein connection should be trivial by the flatness of the metric. Kähler form should satisfy the analog self-duality meaning that locally it is analogous to mutually orthogonal electric and magnetic fields of the same magnitude.</li>
                    <li>Quarks correspond to triality t=1 partial waves and leptons to triality t=0 partial waves. These modes are not simply color triplets for physical quarks and color singlets for physical leptons. For physical fermions, a mechanism producing color triplets for quarks and singlets for leptons is needed.
                    According to the first section of the Appendix, the color partial waves with different charges correspond to color partial waves characterized by an integer pair (p,q). p and q can thought of as giving the numbers of triplets and anti-triplets in the tensor containing the representation in question. The dimension of the color representation is d(p,q) = (1/2)(p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2).
                    In the case of leptons, one has representations (p,p) for neutrinos and (3+p,p) for charged leptons. The dimensions are (p+1)<sup>2</sup>(p+2) for neutrinos and (3+p+1)(p+1)(p+2) for charged leptons (Mistake in original formula, should be (3+p+1)(p+1)(p+2) or similar based on (p,q) general formula, d(3+p,p) = 1/2 (3+p+1)(p+1)(3+p+p+2) = 1/2 (p+4)(p+1)(2p+5) ). The color representations are the same for both CP<sub>2</sub> chiralities which correspond to opposite M<sup>4</sup> chiralities for a fixed H chirality.
                    In the case of quarks one has representations (p+1,p) and (p+4,p) for D resp. U type quarks and the corresponding dimensions are 1/2(p+2)(p+1)(2p+3) resp. 1/2(p+5)(p+1)(2p+5). The two CP<sub>2</sub> chiralities are transformed to each other by D(CP<sub>2</sub>): covariantly right-handed neutrino is an exception since it is annihilated by D(CP<sub>2</sub>).</li>
                    <li>The charge assignable to color partial wave is not a local notion characterized by a spinor index since D(CP<sub>2</sub>) mixes different isospin states, whose identification depends on the choice of the vierbein in CP<sub>2</sub>. This is understandable since the choice of the CP<sub>2</sub> spinor basis is determined apart from a local U(2) rotation. The same problem is encountered in standard model and solved by going to unitary gauge. One can ask whether it might be possible to define the counterpart of the unitary gauge as a global choice of CP<sub>2</sub> vierbein for which the CP<sub>2</sub> spinor is constant or covariantly constant for a given color partial wave.</li>

                            Consider first the possibility that Φ<sub>ε</sub> is the tensor product of the M<sup>4</sup> spinor and the CP<sub>2</sub> spinor with the same or opposite chirality corresponding to quarks and leptons.</li>

                <p>A couple of comments regarding the chiralities are in order.</p>

                <p>For the modes of the induced spinor field the propagation would take place along the spacetime surface and possibly also along a related lower-dimensional surface such as a partonic 2-surface and light-like curves along it.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>This 4-dimensional (or possibly lower-dimensional) propagator corresponds to the inverse of the Dirac operator for the induced gamma matrices as projection of the 8-D vector formed by H gamma matrices. Induced gamma matrices anticommute to the induced metric.</li>
                    <li>One can also consider modified gamma matrices determined as contractions of the canonical momentum currents of the classical action with the gamma matrices of H <a href="#ref-allb-cspin">[cspin, wcwnew (allb)]</a>. These do not anticommute to the induced metric but for them 4-D super-conformal symmetry would be exact and classical field equations would appear as a consistency condition guaranteeing hermiticity.
                    For the induced gamma matrices super-conformal symmetry is violated at the vertices <a href="#ref-btart-whatgravitons">[whatgravitons (btart)]</a>, where the full action makes itself visible: outside the singularities minimal surface property consistent with volume action, giving rise to induced gamma matrices, holds true.</li>
                    <li>The beauty of this view (also that based on H propagator) is that the constructions of the propagator and of the physical states are completely separated from each other. The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator for induced spinors. For H propagator the construction is easy but the situation need not be the same now.</li>
                    <li>One might hope that holography=holomorphy principle <a href="#ref-btart-Frenkel">[Frenkel, Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> allows the explicit construction of the propagator using complex coordinates assignable to the Hamilton-Jacobi structure involving hypercomplex coordinates (u,v) and complex coordinates (w,w̅) <a href="#ref-btart-HJ">[HJ (btart)]</a>. Hypercomplex coordinates (u,v) would be the analogs of light-like coordinates and the Minkowskian signature would make the propagation possible.
                    In the Euclidean situation the propagator would be bilinear in holomorphic and antiholomorphic modes h<sub>1</sub>=h<sub>2</sub> would be a delta function singularity. Now the situation is more complex but one might hope that Wick rotation for the second complex coordinate, transforming it to hypercomplex coordinate, could give the propagator.
                    For light-like curves at partonic orbits identified as fermionic lines, the propagator can be constructed explicitly by a semiclassical argument.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>One can criticize this approach.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>In the case of Minkowski space it is clear what virtuality of the fermion means for the massless case: the explicit expression for the massless fermion propagator implies the massive virtual modes. For virtual modes with p<sup>2</sup>≠0 p<sup>k</sup>γ<sub>k</sub>Ψ is nonvanishing.</li>
                    <li>What could the non-vanishing virtual momentum squared correspond to in the recent case? The condition DΨ = (Γ<sup>k</sup>D<sub>k</sub> + Γ<sup>k̅</sup>D<sub>k̅</sub>)Ψ = 0, reduces for the holomorphic modes, satisfying D<sub>k̅</sub>Ψ=0, to the condition Γ<sup>k</sup>Ψ=0. An analogous condition is true for the antiholomorphic modes.
                    Γ<sup>k</sup>Ψ≠0 should be true for the virtual modes. This condition is consistent with the condition that H chirality is fixed but means mixing of the M<sup>4</sup> chiralities which is the signature of massivation due to the virtual mass.</li>

                <p>The second option is that the propagation takes place in H for the spinor modes of H in such a way that only the endpoints of the propagator D<sub>F</sub>(h<sub>1</sub>,h<sub>2</sub>) are restricted to the space-time surface X<sup>4</sup>. One could say that virtuality in geometric sense for the fermions means that they can leave the space-time surface.

                    This form conforms can be deduced from the scaling invariance.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As one might guess, the propagator has a part, which is a delta function concentrated on the boundary of a double light-cone. The reader can verify this by calculating the 4-D volume integral of S<sub>F</sub>(m=x-y) by using a standard definition of delta function in terms of 4-D volume integral and the basic rules for integrating delta functions.</p>

                <h4 id="deduction-h-propagator" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.3.2 Deduction of the H propagator</h4>
                <p>The separate conservation of lepton and quark numbers forces the counterpart of the massless propagator, not only in H but also in M<sup>4</sup>.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The H propagator corresponds to the inverse of the massless Dirac operator of H. It is essential that the modes have a well-defined H-chirality meaning that lepton and quarks numbers are separately conserved.</li>
                    <li>One could argue that since M<sup>4</sup> masses for spinor modes are given by p<sup>2</sup>=Λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>, where Λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> is the eigenvalue of D(CP<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, each mode gives rise to a propagator with mass Λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>. Since Λ<sub>n</sub> corresponds to CP<sub>2</sub> mass scale, only the covariantly constant right-handed neutrino would propagate above CP<sub>2</sub> mass scale! The other modes would propagate only in the CP<sub>2</sub> length scale. Note however that in M<sup>4</sup> massive propagation along light-like geodesics reduces to massless propagation.
                    The second problem is that for this view the poles at p<sup>2</sup>=Λ<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> do not emerge and must be put in by hand as normalization factors for off-mass-shell states. The reason is that the 1/D<sup>2</sup> factor disappears in the matrix elements of D/(D<sup>2</sup>+iε) between the massive H spinor modes Ψ, which are of form Ψ=DΦ. The only exception is the right-handed neutrino, which is covariantly constant in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom. Only the right-handed neutrino would propagate.
                    The delicate difference with respect to the ordinary massive propagation in M<sup>4</sup> is that the ordinary massive propagator is given by D<sub>F</sub>=1/(p<sup>k</sup>γ<sub>k</sub>+m) = (p<sup>k</sup>γ<sub>k</sub>-m)/(p<sup>2</sup>-m<sup>2</sup>+iε) by p<sup>2</sup>-m<sup>2</sup>=(p<sup>k</sup>γ<sub>k</sub>+m)(p<sup>k</sup>γ<sub>k</sub>-m). In TGD, a propagator massive in M<sup>4</sup> sense is massless in the 8-D sense and one has D<sub>F</sub>=1/D = D/(D<sup>2</sup>+iε).</li>
                    <li>What does the fixing the H-chirality implied by the separate conservation of quark and lepton numbers mean? The H-spinor is a combination of two spinors, where the M<sup>4</sup> and CP<sub>2</sub> chiralities ε<sub>1</sub> and ε<sub>2</sub> are well defined and their product ε=ε<sub>1</sub>ε<sub>2</sub> is +1 or -1 depending on whether it is a quark or a lepton. The combinations (1,-1) and (-1,1) and on the other hand (1,1) and (-1,-1) are possible.
                    But the fixed M<sup>4</sup> chirality means that propagation is like that for a massless fermion in M<sup>4</sup>! The mass spectrum for D(P<sub>2</sub>) does not show itself in the M<sup>4</sup> part of the propagator and the construction of states and of the propagator are completely separate problems. This picture also corresponds to the picture of QCD where massless quarks are assumed as an approximation.</li>
                    <li>What about the propagation in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom? It follows directly from the defining condition that the propagator is a delta function in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom. There is no propagation at all. This just what the Euclidian signature of CP<sub>2</sub> suggests. The matrix elements of the propagator between quantum states constructed from the conformal representations having H spinor modes as ground states are extremely simple and reduce to the same form as in QFTs for fermions with internal quantum numbers.</li>

                <h4 id="h-propagator-consequences" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.3.3 Some consequences</h4>
                <p>This result has some highly non-trivial consequences.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The H propagation includes the constraint that the end points of the propagator belong to the space-time surface through the fact that h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub> are on the same spacetime surface. Since there is no propagation at all in CP<sub>2</sub> the points s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub> are identical!
                    The condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> at the spacetime surface gives two complex conditions for s<sub>2</sub> when s<sub>1</sub> is fixed and the result is a discrete set of points on the spacetime surface! Only in these cases does propagation occur. The theory discretizes itself in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom! Discretization would not be an approximation but a prediction of the theory. This is the basic idea behind the identification of cognitive representation as a number theoretic discretization using points of the embedding space for which H coordinates make sense both as real numbers and numbers in an extension of p-adic numbers.</li>
                    <li>The light-like parton orbits are in a special role now since the partonic 2-surfaces at the ends of the parton orbit can have a large number of common points if their CP<sub>2</sub> projections are identical. This would explain why they are physically in exceptional position.
                    The picture of propagation along light-like geodesics suggest by physical intuition is consistent with the condition s<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>2</sub> but a light-like geodesic is not needed for the H-propagator.</li>
                    <li>From this it should be easy to understand what happens in quark and color confinement (gluons are bound states of quarks and antiquarks in TGD). The classical time evolution involves the failure of classical determinism identifiable as p-adic non-determinism <a href="#ref-btart-Langlands2025">[Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a>. There is a sequence of analogs of multifurcations involving non-determinism. In this sequence the number of common points possessed by the initial and final partonic orbits decreases and eventually the propagator amplitude becomes very small. This means color confinement.</li>

First the TGD view of electroweak and color interactions is compared with the standard view. After that the general solutions of the Dirac equation in H are discussed.</p>

                <p>TGD based vision standard model interactions differs in several respects from the standard view.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>In TGD, elementary particles correspond to closed monopole flux tubes as analogs of hadronic strings connecting two Minkowskian space-time sheets by Euclidean wormhole contacts. The light-like orbits of wormhole throats (partonic orbits) carry fermions and antifermions at light curves located at light-like 3-surfaces, which define interfaces between Minkowskian string world regions and Euclidean regions identified as deformed CP<sub>2</sub> type extremals.</li>
                    <li>The basic difference at the level of H spinor fields is that color quantum numbers are not spin-like but are replaced with color partial waves in CP<sub>2</sub>. Color degrees of freedom are analogous to the rotational degrees of freedom of a rigid body. An infinite number of color partial waves emerges for both quarks and leptons. In TGD, color and electroweak degrees of freedom are strongly correlated as is also clear from the fact that color symmetries correspond to the non-broken symmetries as isometries of CP<sub>2</sub> and electroweak symmetries correspond to the holonomies of CP<sub>2</sub>, which are automatically broken gauge symmetries.
                    The spectrum of color partial waves in H is different for U and D type quarks and for charged leptons and neutrinos. The triality of the partial wave is zero for leptons and 1 resp. -1 for quarks resp. antiquarks. At the level of fundamental fermions, which do not correspond as such to fermions as elementary particles, there is a strong violation of isospin symmetry.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The physical states are constructed using p-adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-mless-elvafu">[mless, elvafu (allb)]</a> <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> for the scaling generator L<sub>0</sub> of the conformal symmetries extended to the space-time level and involve the action of Kac-Moody type algebras.
                The basic challenge of the state construction of the physical states is to obtain physical states with correct color quantum numbers.</p>

                    The spinors assignable to left and right handed neutrino correspond to representations of color group of type (p,p), where the integers and only right-handed neutrino allows singlet (0,0) as covariantly constant CP<sub>2</sub> spinor mode. (1,1) corresponds to octet 8. Charged leptons allow representations of type (3+p,p): p=0 corresponds to decuplet 10.
                    Note that (0,3) corresponds to 10̅.
                    Quarks correspond to irreps of type obtained from leptons by adding one quarks that is replacing (p+3,p) with (p+4,p) (p=0 gives d=20) or (p,p) with (p+1,p) (p=1 gives d=42). Antiquarks are obtained by replacing (p,p+3) replaced with (p,p+4) and (p,p) with (p,p+1).</li>
                    <li>Physical leptons (quarks) are color singlets (triplets). One can imagine two ways to achieve this.
                        <p><b>Option I:</b> The conformal generators act on the ground state defined by the spinor harmonic of H. Could the tensor product of the conformal generators with spinor modes give a color singlet state for leptons and triplet state for quarks? The constraint that Kac-Moody type generators annihilate the physical states, realizing conformal invariance, might pose severe difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In fact, TGD leads to the proposal that there is a hierarchical symmetry breaking for conformal half-algebras containing a hierarchy of isomorphic sub-algebras with conformal weights coming as multiplets of the weights of the entire algebra. This would make the gauge symmetry of the subalgebra with weights below given maximal weight to a physical symmetry.</p>
                        <p><b>Option II:</b> The proposal is that the wormhole throats also contain pairs of left- and right-handed neutrinos guaranteeing that the total electroweak quantum numbers of the string-like closed monopole flux tube representing hadron vanishes. This would make the weak interactions short-ranged with the range determined by the length of the string-like object.</p>
                        <p>One must study the tensor products of ν<sub>L</sub>ν̅<sub>R</sub> and ν̅<sub>L</sub>ν<sub>R</sub> states with the leptonic (quark) spinor harmonic to see whether it is possible to obtain singlet (triplet) states. The tensor product of a neutrino octet with a neutrino type spinor contains a color singlet. The tensor product 8⊗8 = 1+8<sub>A</sub>+8<sub>S</sub>+10+10̅+27 contains 10̅ and its tensor product with 10 for quark contains a color triplet.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The ground states for the Super Virasoro representations correspond to spinor harmonics in M<sup>4</sup> × CP<sub>2</sub> characterized by momentum and color quantum numbers. The correlation between color and electro-weak quantum numbers is wrong for the spinor harmonics and these states would be also hyper-massive. One can imagine two mechanisms.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The super-symplectic generators could allow to build color triplet states having negative vacuum conformal weights, and their values are such that p-adic massivation is consistent with the predictions of the earlier model differing from the recent one in the quark sector. In the following the construction and the properties of the color partial waves for fermions and bosons are considered. The discussion follows closely to the discussion of <a href="#ref-bmat-Pope">[Pope (bmat)]</a>.</li>
                    <li>In the concrete model for elementary particles a pair of left- and right-handed neutrino associated with the monopole flux tube screens weak isospin above weak boson Compton length. This pair could be in such color partial waves that the outcome is leptonic color singlet and quark color triplet.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the sequel only the color partial waves in H are discussed. This reduces to the discussion of the eigenstates of CP<sub>2</sub> d'Alembertian whose eigestates the spinor harmonics are.</p>

                <h3 id="general-construction-dirac-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">A.2 General construction of solutions of Dirac operator of H</h3>
                <p>The construction of the solutions of massless spinor and other d'Alembertians in M<sup>4</sup><sub>+</sub>×CP<sub>2</sub> is based on the following observations.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>d'Alembertian corresponds to a massless wave equation M<sup>4</sup>×CP<sub>2</sub> and thus Kaluza-Klein picture applies, that is M<sup>4</sup><sub>+</sub> mass is generated from the momentum in CP<sub>2</sub> degrees of freedom. This implies mass quantization:
                    <p class="equation">M<sup>2</sup> = M<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> ,</p>
                    where M<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> are eigenvalues of CP<sub>2</sub> Laplacian. Here of course, ordinary field theory is considered. In TGD the vacuum weight changes mass squared spectrum.</li>
                    <li>In order to get a respectable spinor structure in CP<sub>2</sub> one must couple CP<sub>2</sub> spinors to an odd integer multiple of the Kähler gauge potential. Leptons and quarks correspond to n=3 and n=1 couplings respectively. The spectrum of the electromagnetic charge comes out correctly for leptons and quarks.</li>
                    <li>Right handed neutrino is covariantly constant solution of CP<sub>2</sub> Laplacian for n=3 coupling to Kähler gauge potential whereas right handed "electron" corresponds to the covariantly constant solution for n=-3. From the covariant constancy it follows that all solutions of the spinor Laplacian are obtained from these two basic solutions by multiplying with an appropriate solution of the scalar Laplacian coupled to Kähler gauge potential with such a coupling that a correct total Kähler charge results. Left handed solutions of spinor Laplacian are obtained simply by multiplying right handed solutions with CP<sub>2</sub> Dirac operator: in this operation the eigenvalues of the mass squared operator are obviously preserved.</li>
                    <li>The remaining task is to solve scalar Laplacian coupled to an arbitrary integer multiple of Kähler gauge potential. This can be achieved by noticing that the solutions of the massive CP<sub>2</sub> Laplacian can be regarded as solutions of S<sup>5</sup> scalar Laplacian. S<sup>5</sup> can indeed be regarded as a circle bundle over CP<sub>2</sub> and massive solutions of CP<sub>2</sub> Laplacian correspond to the solutions of S<sup>5</sup> Laplacian with exp(isτ) dependence on S<sup>1</sup> coordinate such that s corresponds to the coupling to the Kähler gauge potential:
                    <p class="equation">s = n/2 .</p>
                    Thus one obtains
                    <p class="equation">D<sup>2</sup><sub>5</sub> = (D<sub>μ</sub> - iA<sub>μ</sub>∂<sub>τ</sub>)(D<sup>μ</sup> - iA<sup>μ</sup>∂<sub>τ</sub>) + ∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup></p>
                    so that the eigen values of CP<sub>2</sub> scalar Laplacian are
                    <p class="equation">m<sup>2</sup>(s) = m<sub>5</sub><sup>2</sup> + s<sup>2</sup></p>
                    for the assumed dependence on τ.</li>
                    <li>What remains to do, is to find the spectrum of S<sup>5</sup> Laplacian and this is an easy task. All solutions of S<sup>5</sup> Laplacian can be written as homogenous polynomial functions of C<sup>3</sup> complex coordinates Z<sup>k</sup> and their complex conjugates and have a decomposition into the representations of SU(3) acting in natural manner in C<sup>3</sup>.</li>
                    <li>The solutions of the scalar Laplacian belong to the representations (p,p+s) for s≥0 and to the representations (p+|s|, p) of SU(3) for s≤0. The eigenvalues m<sup>2</sup>(s) and degeneracies d are
                    <p class="equation">
m<sup>2</sup>(s) = (2Λ/3)[p<sup>2</sup> + (|s|+2)p + |s|] ,  p>0 ,<br/>
d = (1/2)(p+1)(p+|s|+1)(2p+|s|+2) .
                    </p>
                    Λ denotes the “cosmological constant” of CP<sub>2</sub> (R<sub>ij</sub>= Λs<sub>ij</sub>).</li>

                <p>Right handed solutions of the leptonic spinor Laplacian are obtained from the ansatz of form</p>

                <p>where e<sup>0</sup><sub>R</sub> is covariantly constant for n=-3 coupling to Kähler gauge potential so that scalar function must have Kähler coupling s=n/2=3 a in order to get a correct Kähler charge. The d'Alembert equation reduces to</p>

                <p>The two additional terms correspond to the curvature scalar term and J<sub>kl</sub>Σ<sup>kl</sup> terms in spinor Laplacian. The latter term is proportional to Kähler coupling and of different sign for ν and e, which explains the presence of the sign factor ε in the formula.</p>
                <p>Right handed neutrinos correspond to (p,p) states with p≥0 with mass spectrum</p>
                <p class="equation">
m<sup>2</sup>(ν) = (m<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/3)[p<sup>2</sup> + 2p] ,  p≥0 ,<br/>
m<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> ≡ 2Λ .
                </p>
                <p>Right handed “electrons” correspond to (p,p+3) states with mass spectrum</p>
                <p class="equation">m<sup>2</sup>(e) = (m<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/3)[p<sup>2</sup> + 5p + 6] ,  p≥0 .</p>
                <p>Left handed solutions are obtained by operating with CP<sub>2</sub> Dirac operator on right handed solutions with one exception: the action of the Dirac operator on the covariantly constant right handed neutrino ((p=0,p=0) state) annihilates it.</p>

                <h4 id="quark-spectrum" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">A.2.2 Quark spectrum</h4>
                <p>Quarks correspond to the second conserved H-chirality of H-spinors. The construction of the color partial waves for quarks proceeds along similar lines as for leptons. The Kähler coupling corresponds to n=1 (and s=1/2) and right handed U type quark corresponds to a right handed neutrino. U quark type solutions are constructed as solutions of form</p>
                <p class="equation">U<sub>R</sub> = u<sub>R</sub>Φ<sub>s=-1</sub> ,</p>
                <p>where u<sub>R</sub> possesses the quantum numbers of covariantly constant right handed neutrino with Kähler charge n=3 (s=3/2). Hence Φ<sub>s</sub> has s=-1. For D<sub>R</sub> one has</p>

                <p>d<sub>R</sub> has s=-3/2 so that one must have s=2. For U<sub>R</sub> the representations (p+1,p) with triality one are obtained and p=0 corresponds to color triplet. For D<sub>R</sub> the representations (p,p+2) are obtained and color triplet is missing from the spectrum (p=0 corresponds to 6̅).</p>
                <p>The CP<sub>2</sub> contributions to masses are given by the formula</p>
                <p class="equation">
m<sup>2</sup>(U,p) = (m<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/3)[p<sup>2</sup>+3p+2] ,  p≥0 ,<br/>
m<sup>2</sup>(D,p) = (m<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/3)[p<sup>2</sup>+4p+4] ,  p≥0 .
                </p>
                <p>Left handed quarks are obtained by applying Dirac operator to right handed quark states and mass formulas and color partial wave spectrum are the same as for right handed quarks.</p>
                <p>The color contributions to p-adic mass squared are integer valued if m<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>/3 is taken as a fundamental p-adic unit of mass squared. This choice has an obvious relevance for p-adic mass calculations since canonical identification does not commute with a division by integer. More precisely, the images of number xp in canonical identification has a value of order 1 when x is a non-trivial rational whereas for x=np the value is n/p and extremely is small for physically interesting primes. This choice does not however affect the spectrum of massless states but can affect the spectrum of light states in case of electro-weak gauge bosons.</p>

                <p>There are several foundational questions involved. What is the origin of the p-adicity? What is the justification of p-adic thermodynamics and what does it have a counterpart at quantum level? What are the poorly understood aspects of p-adic thermodynamics? What is the understanding of generalized superconformal representations and possible interpretational and technical problems.</p>

                <h3 id="questions-padic-thermo" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.1 Questions related to the p-adic thermodynamics</h3>
                <p>The nice feature of both approaches is that the propagators carry a minimum amount of information about the quantum states at the 3-surfaces to which the end points of the propagator are associated. Therefore the construction of physical states with correct total color quantum numbers do not affect the propagators. One also circumvents the problem how to take into account the massivation by p-adic thermodynamics at the level of the fermionic propagators.</p>
                <p>This construction says nothing about how physical fermions are constructed and how the get their masses via p-adic thermodynamics.</p>

                <h4 id="origin-padic-thermo" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">3.1.1 The origin of p-adic thermodynamics</h4>
                <p>The understanding of the origin of p-adic thermodynamics is the first challenge.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>In p-adic thermodynamics, the scaling generator L<sub>0</sub> takes the role of energy as a generator of time translations. Ordinary 2-D conformal invariance requires that physical states are annihilated by L<sub>0</sub>. All states created by L<sub>0</sub> would correspond to gauge degrees of freedom. This cannot be the case in p-adic thermodynamics.
                    In TGD, the conformal algebras are replaced by half-algebras <a href="#ref-btart-wcwsymm">[wcwsymm (btart)]</a>, which allow an infinite hierarchy of sub-algebras isomorphic to the full algebra, which means that a finite-dimensional sub-algebra transforms from gauge algebra to a dynamical symmetry algebra and p-adic thermodynamics applies to states in this finite-dimensional state space.</li>
                    <li>In the 2-D version of the p-adic thermodynamics, the ground state is necessarily tachyonic with a negative conformal weight representing the mass squared. The physical ground state with a vanishing mass squared is obtained by applying conformal generators with a positive conformal weight. Where do the generators with tachyonic conformal weight come from?
                        <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                            <li>p-Adic thermodynamics in its recent formulation <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> answers this question by extending the conformal algebra from dimension 2 to dimension 4 so that one has hypercomplex and complex coordinate and there are conformal weights associated with both of them. The 4-dimensional conformal invariance is realized in holography=holomorphy (H-H) vision involving the notion of Hamilton-Jacobi structure in an essential way <a href="#ref-brart-HJ">[HJ (brart)]</a>. There are conformal weights associated with hypercomplex resp. complex coordinates and the corresponding conformal weights are non-negative resp. negative. Their sum vanishes for massless ground states.</li>
                            <li>M<sup>8</sup>-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-TGDcritics">[TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> provides further insights to the tachyon problem. In M<sup>8</sup>, the momentum space M<sup>4</sup> corresponds to a quaternionic subspace of octonions realized as the normal space of point y of the 4-surfaces Y<sup>4</sup>⊂ M<sup>8</sup>. The point y carries the fermion. The 8-D mass squared always vanishes but the M<sup>4</sup> part is in general non-vanishing. For some points y∈Y<sup>4</sup> the normal space M<sup>4</sup> is such that the E<sup>4</sup> part of the 8-momentum vanishes and the particle is massless in M<sup>4</sup> sense. This is the counterpart for the cancellation of the two conformal weights at the level of H.</li>

                <h4 id="problem-superconformal" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">3.1.2 A possible problem with super-conformal representations</h4>
                <p>What about the higher conformal excitations giving rise to the p-adic thermal mass? There does not seem to be any point or need to modify the massless propagators since they are associated with the ground state of the super-conformal representations. There is however a problem.</p>
                <p>In string models the super generators G<sub>n</sub> of Ramond representation and G<sub>n+1/2</sub> of Neveu-Schwarz representation define the analog of the Dirac operator. The anticommutators {G<sub>m</sub>,G<sub>n</sub><sup>†</sup>} and {G<sub>m+1/2</sub>,G<sub>n+1/2</sub><sup>†</sup>} give Virasoro generators L<sub>n</sub>. In the Ramond representation one has G<sub>0</sub>= p<sup>k</sup>γ<sub>k</sub> +G<sub>vib,0</sub>. The Ramond representation therefore contains the ordinary Dirac operator acting in cm degrees of freedom.</p>
                <p>In p-adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-mless-padmass2022">[mless, padmass2022 (allb)]</a> based on the TGD view of conformal invariance <a href="#ref-btart-wcwsymm">[wcwsymm (btart)]</a>, the Majorana option is not possible. Since the ordinary gamma matrices do not carry a fermion number, the Ramond formula of G would involve generators with a vanishing fermion number and non-vanishing fermion number. Same applies also to G<sub>n</sub>.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>A possible solution of the problem is that super generators and their Hermitian conjugates define two kinds of supergenerators. For Ramond representation, this would also include the counterparts of ordinary gamma matrices. The algebra creating the states would involve only non-negative conformal weights and possess a fractal hierarchy of included sub-algebras isomorphic to the entire algebra.</li>
                    <li>Could G<sub>0</sub> is non-hermitian so that both G<sub>0</sub> resp. G<sub>0</sub><sup>†</sup> carrying a fermion number 1 resp. -1 are allowed. The counterparts of M<sup>4</sup> gamma matrices would be analogous to fermionic creation and annihilation operators, which would correspond to a complex structure in center-or mass degrees of freedom.
                    Could the Hamilton-Jacobi structure <a href="#ref-btart-HJ">[HJ (btart)]</a> for M<sup>4</sup> based on hyper-complex and complex structure make this possible. The conjugation for complex coordinate and its hypercomplex counterpart would correspond to the hermitian conjugation for the operators γ<sub>u</sub> and γ<sub>w</sub> producing γ<sub>u</sub><sup>†</sup>=γ<sub>v</sub> and γ<sub>w</sub><sup>†</sup>=γ<sub>w̅</sub> for both leptonic and quark-like representations. These gamma matrices would act as quantum operators.</li>
                    <li>Or are only Neveu-Schwarz representations for which all generators G<sub>n+1/2</sub> can carry a well-defined fermion number possible? The problem is that in p-adic mass calculations fermions correspond to Ramond representations with different degeneracies for states with a given conformal weight.</li>
                    <li>Could zero energy ontology (ZEO) <a href="#ref-alb-zeoquestions">[zeoquestions (alb)]</a> <a href="#ref-btart-zeocriticality">[zeocriticality (btart)]</a> come to rescue? Could these states be regarded as superpositions of pairs of states at opposite boundaries CD with opposite fermion numbers so that there would be no conflict with the superselection rule for fermion numbers. Could the time-like entanglement between the states at the boundaries of causal diamond (CD) relate to the p-adic thermodynamics or rather, its square root. What about the relationship to the model of superconductivity in terms of quantum coherent states of Cooper pairs?</li>

                <h4 id="origin-padicity" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">3.1.3 Questions related to the origin of p-adicity</h4>
                <p>One can also make ontological questions related to p-adicity.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>What is the origin of the p-adicity? H-H vision <a href="#ref-btart-Langlands2025">[Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> has led to a considerable progress in the attempts to understand the origin of p-adicity and the p-adic length scale hypothesis. The notion of functional p-adic numbers suggests how the p-adicization and adelization emerge. One can even ask whether it is necessary to introduce the p-adic and adelic variants of the embedding space in this approach.</li>
                    <li>p-Adic thermodynamics is a statistical description and must be an approximation to a genuine quantal description. Quantum TGD can be formally regarded as a square root of thermodynamics at a quantum critical temperature defined by the Kähler coupling strength <a href="#ref-allb-UandM">[UandM, vNeumannnew (allb)]</a>. Could it make sense to speak of a square root of p-adic thermodynamics in which thermal probabilities correspond to quantal probabilities. Thermal state would be replaced by a quantum state. Very naively, thermodynamic weights would be replaced with their complex square roots, that is ordinary square roots involving a phase factor.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="8d-relativity" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.2 Does 8-dimensionality imply 8-dimensional relativity?</h3>
                <p>One cannot avoid the question whether 8-dimensionality implies an 8-D generalization of relativity.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>The completely new element is that at M<sup>8</sup> level M<sup>4</sup> as normal space is not fixed but dynamical: could one speak of relativity for mass squared? The Lorentz boosts of this relativity could correspond to the Lorentz group SO(1,7) of M<sup>8</sup>. Also G<sub>2</sub> as a subgroup affects the M<sup>4</sup> mass squared values since it does not leave quaternionic subspace M<sup>4</sup> invariant although it does not affect the energy.</li>
                    <li>Masslessness in the 8-D sense at M<sup>8</sup> level forces us to challenge the assumption that the particles always have a well-defined 4-D mass squared. As a matter of fact, p-adic thermodynamics and its possible quantum variant as a square root of thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-UandM-vNeumannnew">[UandM, vNeumannnew (allb)]</a> already does this. Could one think that mass is more like a transversal or longitudinal momentum squared and depends on the state of motion characterized by the normal space of Y<sup>4</sup>?</li>
                    <li>What about color quantum numbers: could 8-D relativity apply even to them. This would change dramatically the views of color. In M<sup>8</sup>, SO(4) acting on E<sup>4</sup>⊂ M<sup>8</sup> is the counterpart of SU(3) acting in CP<sub>2</sub>⊂ H and also as a subgroup SU(3)⊂ G<sub>2</sub> of octonion automorphisms leaving invariant the octonion unit defining M<sup>4</sup> time direction in the normal space. M<sup>4</sup> as a quaternionic normal space of Y<sup>4</sup> varies and therefore also the subgroup SU(3)⊂ G<sub>2</sub>. Suppose that one replaces normal space-with a new one by deforming Y<sup>4</sup> such that the point y∈E<sup>4</sup> is not affected. What happens?
                    I have asked whether SO(4)-SU(3) duality between hadron physics and QCD type physics could correspond to M<sup>8</sup>-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-M8H">[M8H1, M8H2, TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a>. Could M<sup>8</sup>-H duality map the 2 Cartan quantum numbers of SO(4) representations appearing in M<sup>8</sup> spinor harmonics to those of SU(3) representations of H spinor harmonics. Could the representations of SU(3) be restricted to the U(2) subgroup of the covering group of SO(4) in accordance with the left-right asymmetry of the standard model?
                    Suppose that SO(1,7) and also G<sub>2</sub> transformations affect the SO(4) representations. If so, then by M<sup>8</sup>-H duality in the proposed form they also affect the SU(3) color partial waves for H spinors. By color confinement this is however not easy to observe.</li>

                <h3 id="m8-h-duality-consistency" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.3 Is the proposed picture consistent with M<sup>8</sup>-H duality</h3>
                <p>M<sup>8</sup>-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-TGDcritics-HHtwistor">[TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> plays a central role in TGD. Therefore one can also worry about whether octotwistors, which for physical states must reduce in some sense to quaternionic twistors, are a well-defined notion. The octonionic spinors must reduce to quaternionic spinors for the physical states in some sense. Massless Dirac equation must be satisfied and the analogs of the chirality conditions for H, M<sup>4</sup> and CP<sub>2</sub> must make sense.</p>
                <p>In the sequel the massless octonionic Dirac equation will be discussed.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>Octonionic and quaternionic spinors are very much analogous to the 2-spinors appearing in the definition of twistors since γ<sup>0</sup> in the Dirac equation is replaced with a real octonion unit. The masslessness condition is obtained when Minkowski inner product is defined as the real part for the product of octonions. The counterparts of sigma matrices are identified as quaternions and octonions and matrix representations for the quaternionic units are not used. This allows the introduction of a commuting imaginary unit i doubling the number of degrees of freedom and replacing octospinors with their complexified counterparts.</li>
                    <li>The octonionic Dirac equation looks like the ordinary Dirac equation but with gamma matrices replaced with octonionic units. The quaternionic Dirac equation involves quaternionic units but it is essential that they are not represented as matrices. This allows the introduction of imaginary uni i commuting with the quaternionic and octonionic units and implies double of the degrees of freedom so that one can have analogs of complex spinors.
                    The octonionic units are analogs of Pauli sigma matrices and the first problem is caused by the lacking anticommutativity of the real unit with other octonion units. The Dirac equation however makes sense also in this case.</li>
                    <li>The 8-D masslessness condition must correspond to the condition that the real part of the square of Dirac operator on spinors vanishes. For momentum eigenstates this gives the usual algebraic conditions for masslessness.</li>
                    <li>H spinors have a defined H-chirality guaranteeing separate conservation of quark and lepton numbers. H-chirality ε is a product ε=ε<sub>1</sub>ε<sub>2</sub> of M<sup>4</sup> and CP<sub>2</sub> chiralities. Alls these chiralities should be definable also at the level of M<sup>8</sup>. Also the octonionic Dirac equation for H spinors should be consistent with the chirality condition.
                        <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                            <li>The decomposition of octonion units to quaternion units {1,I<sub>k</sub>|k=1,2,3} and co-quaternion units I<sub>4</sub>{1,I<sub>k</sub>|k=1,2,3} suggests the identification of the counterpart of Γ<sub>9</sub>. The matrix Γ<sub>9</sub> is defined as the product of H gamma matrices satisfies Γ<sub>9</sub><sup>2</sup>=-1, anticommutes with H gamma matrices. H chirality corresponds to the eigenvalue of iΓ<sub>9</sub> equal to ε=±1. The eigen spinors with chirality ε are of the form (1+εiΓ<sub>9</sub>)Ψ<sub>0</sub>.
                            The spinors with fixed H-chirality are tensor products of spinors of fixed M<sup>4</sup> chirality and CP<sub>2</sub> chirality and the product of these chiralities defines H-chirality.</li>
                            <li>The operator iI<sub>4</sub>, satisfying (iI<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2</sup>=1, is a good guess for the counterpart of Γ<sub>9</sub> for the octonionic spinors. The octospinors with a fixed M<sup>8</sup> chirality ε should be of the form (1+εiI<sub>4</sub>)Ψ<sub>0</sub>. It is easy to check that for an octospinor of form Ψ<sub>ε</sub>=Ψ<sub>a</sub>+I<sub>4</sub>Ψ<sub>b</sub> having a fixed chirality ε, one obtains
                            <p class="equation">Ψ<sub>b</sub> = iεΨ<sub>a</sub></p>
                            so that the spinor is determined completely by its quaternionic part. Perhaps this might be regarded as a realization of quaterniocity.</li>
                            <li>One can decompose also the quaternionic spinors to two parts corresponding to the decomposition to complex subspace spanned by {1,I<sub>1</sub>} and co-complex subspace spanned by {I<sub>2</sub>,I<sub>3</sub>}. This allows us to define M<sup>4</sup> chirality and its E<sup>4</sup> counterpart.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Octonionic Dirac equation for the momentum eigenstates can be decomposed to a sum of quaternionic and co-quaternionic parts
                    <p class="equation">DΨ = (p<sup>k</sup><sub>1</sub>I<sub>k</sub> + I<sub>4</sub>p<sup>k</sup><sub>2</sub>I<sub>k</sub>)Ψ = 0 .</p>
                    The real part of D<sup>2</sup> gives the Minkowskian mass shell condition p<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>-p<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.
                    The Dirac equation for the Ψ<sub>ε</sub>= (1+iεI<sub>4</sub>)Ψ<sub>0</sub> gives
                    <p class="equation">
DΨ<sub>0</sub> = (p<sup>k</sup><sub>1</sub>I<sub>k</sub> + I<sub>4</sub>p<sup>k</sup><sub>2</sub>I<sub>k</sub>)Ψ<sub>0</sub> + D̃Ψ̃<sub>0</sub> = 0 .<br/>
D̃ = (p̃<sup>k</sup><sub>1</sub>I<sub>k</sub> + I<sub>4</sub>p̃<sup>k</sup><sub>2</sub>I<sub>k</sub>) .
                    </p>
                    Tilde means a conjugation of quaternionic imaginary units. This gives two separate equations? Are they consistent? By multiplying the equation with tildes by 1=-I<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> from left and transporting the second I<sub>4</sub> through the equation to right, one obtains the equation -I<sub>2</sub>(p<sup>k</sup><sub>1</sub>I<sub>k</sub> + I<sub>4</sub>p<sup>k</sup><sub>2</sub>I<sub>k</sub>)Ψ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>5</sub>=0. The two equations are therefore consistent.</li>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
In this article the notion of fermion propagator is discussed. It is found that the construction is much more than a mere computational challenge. There are two alternative approaches. Fermionic propagation could correspond to a) a 4-D or lower-dimensional propagation at the space-time level for the induced spinor fields as analog of massless propagation or b) to 8-D propagation in \(H\) between points belonging to the space-time surface.
    </p>
    <p>
For the option b) the separate conservations of baryon and lepton number requires fixed \(H\)-chirality so that the spinor mode is sum of products of \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) spinors with fixed \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities whose product is +1 or -1. This implies that \(M^4\) propagation is massless. The Euclidean signature of \(CP_2\) in turn suggests that there is no propagation in \(CP_2\) and the \(CP_2\) projections \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) for the ends of the propagator line are the same. This allows a very simple form for the matrix elements of the propagator and the condition \(s_1=s_2\) implies that the propagation from \(s_1\) is possible to a discrete set of points \(s_2\). This has direct relevance for the understanding of color confinement and more or less implies the intuitively deduced TGD based model for elementary particles.

Although the option a) need not provide a realistic propagator, it could provide a very useful semiclassical picture. If the condition \(s_1=s_2\) is assumed, fermionic propagation along light-like geodesics of \(H\) is favored and in accordance with the model for elementary particles. This allows a classical space-time picture of particle massivation by p-adic thermodynamics and color confinement.

    <p>
Also the interpretational and technical problems related to the construction of 4-D variants of super-conformal representations having spinor modes as ground states and to the p-adic thermodynamics are discussed.

It encapsulates how spinor fields are differentiated in a curved, complex manifold setting, incorporating both geometric and algebraic structures. The gamma matrices encode the spinor representation of the Clifford algebra, ensuring the operator acts correctly on spinor fields respecting the manifold's geometry.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in CP2 Dirac Operator</h3>\n<p>\nIn the context of $CP_2$, a complex 2-dimensional projective space, the Dirac operator plays a crucial role in analyzing fermionic fields and their dynamics. It generalizes the flat-space Dirac operator to curved space, incorporating the manifold's metric and spin connection. Equation 4 succinctly captures this by expressing the operator as a sum over gamma matrices and covariant derivatives, which together account for the curvature and complex structure of $CP_2$.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nSuppose we have a spinor field $\\psi$ on $CP_2$.

                <p>Memory, the cognitive capability enabling the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information, stands as a cornerstone of human experience and function. It is indispensable for performing daily activities, forming relationships, learning, and progressing through life; indeed, memory fundamentally shapes our identity.<sup>1</sup> The study of memory is an inherently interdisciplinary endeavor, attracting profound interest from fields ranging from psychology and neuroscience, which seek to understand its behavioral manifestations and biological underpinnings, to more speculative yet potentially transformative inquiries rooted in fundamental physics. This report aims to navigate this diverse landscape, offering a comprehensive exploration of how memory is conceptualized and investigated across these varied domains.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Addressing the User's Inquiry: A Roadmap for Exploring Memory Across Disciplines</h3>
                <p>This document will systematically address the core components of the user's inquiry. It will commence with an overview of established and currently influential models of memory within psychology and neuroscience, detailing their proposed architectures and mechanisms. Subsequently, the discussion will transition to the domain of quantum mechanics, examining how its ontological principles might support or provide a novel basis for understanding memory processes, a field marked by both intriguing possibilities and significant challenges. Finally, the report will delve into the complex and unconventional framework of

                    as developed by Matti Pitkänen. This section will elucidate TGD's unique description of memory and explore the profound new contributions it could offer to fundamental physics were its model of memory to find empirical substantiation. Throughout this exploration, the report will navigate a spectrum of theories, from those firmly grounded in empirical observation to those that are highly theoretical, striving for a balanced and analytical presentation of each.</p>
                <p>The very definition of "memory" has not remained static but has co-evolved with scientific advancements and theoretical paradigms. Early investigations, such as those by Ebbinghaus and William James, focused primarily on retention periods and made initial distinctions between types of memory, like primary and secondary memory.<sup>2</sup> As research progressed, the conceptualization of memory shifted. Later models, particularly within cognitive psychology and neuroscience, began to emphasize the active processing and manipulation of information, as exemplified by the development of working memory models.<sup>2</sup> Concurrently, the understanding of long-term memory diversified, recognizing distinct systems such as episodic, semantic, and procedural memory.<sup>1</sup> More recently, highly theoretical frameworks like Topological Geometrodynamics have proposed even more radical reconceptualizations, suggesting that memory might be an intrinsic property of a 4-dimensional spacetime and consciousness itself.<sup>4</sup> This historical trajectory, from relatively simple storage metaphors to models emphasizing dynamic processing, and further to ontological redefinitions that question the fundamental nature of memory, indicates a deepening inquiry. Initially, memory was largely seen as a faculty for storing past events. Neuroscience then began to unravel the "how" in terms of underlying neural structures and processes. Now, theories emerging from physics, including quantum theories and TGD, are probing the "what" of memory at an even more fundamental level, questioning whether it is purely an informational phenomenon or if it is inextricably linked to the fabric of reality and the nature of consciousness. This evolving understanding underscores the complexity of memory and highlights how each new scientific perspective adds layers of understanding or poses new challenges to previous conceptions, thereby setting the stage for appreciating why radically different theoretical approaches, such as TGD, have emerged.</p>

                <p>The scientific endeavor to understand memory has yielded a rich tapestry of models, each contributing to our comprehension of how information is acquired, retained, and utilized. These models range from foundational frameworks that describe the basic architecture of memory systems to more nuanced theories that detail specific processes and LTM subsystems, and computational approaches that seek to simulate memory functions.</p>
                
                <h3 id="foundational-frameworks" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">2.1. Foundational Frameworks: Structuring the Flow of Information</h3>
                <p>Among the earliest and most influential attempts to delineate the structure of memory is the Multi-Store Model (MSM), proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968. This model posits that memory is not a unitary entity but consists of three distinct stores: the Sensory Register (SR), Short-Term Memory (STM), and Long-Term Memory (LTM).<sup>1</sup> According to the MSM, information flows sequentially through these stores. Sensory information first enters the SR, which has a very limited duration, holding information for approximately half a second before it is forgotten unless attended to.<sup>6</sup> If information in the SR is attended to, it moves into STM, which is characterized by a limited capacity (typically around 5-9 items, though this can be expanded through strategies like "chunking") and a duration of approximately 30 seconds without active maintenance.<sup>6</sup> Encoding in STM is primarily thought to be acoustic or visual. Finally, through processes such as rehearsal, information can be transferred from STM to LTM, which is considered to have a seemingly unlimited capacity and can store information for durations ranging from minutes to a lifetime.<sup>6</sup> Encoding in LTM is predominantly semantic, based on meaning.<sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>The MSM was a pioneering framework that provided a foundational architecture for memory research, stimulating further investigation into the characteristics of these distinct memory stages.<sup>6</sup> However, the model has also faced criticism for being overly passive and linear, and for oversimplifying the nature of STM and LTM.<sup>1</sup> For example, the idea that LTM is primarily encoded semantically does not adequately explain procedural memory, such as the skill of riding a bicycle.<sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>These limitations spurred the development of more dynamic models, particularly for the short-term component of memory. The concept of Working Memory (WM) emerged to address the perceived oversimplification of STM in the MSM, shifting the focus from mere temporary storage to the active manipulation and processing of information in the service of complex cognitive tasks such as reasoning, learning, and comprehension.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>One of the most prominent WM models is the multi-component model proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974 and later revised by Baddeley in 2000. This model conceptualizes WM as a system comprising several interacting components.<sup>2</sup> The central executive acts as a supervisory attentional system responsible for the control and regulation of cognitive processes; its functions include directing focus, coordinating the "slave systems," switching between tasks or retrieval strategies, and inhibiting irrelevant information.<sup>7</sup> The two primary slave systems are the phonological loop, which processes and temporarily stores verbal and auditory information through a mechanism of rehearsal, and the visuospatial sketchpad, which handles visual and spatial information.<sup>7</sup> In a later revision, Baddeley introduced the episodic buffer, a limited-capacity temporary storage system capable of integrating information from the phonological loop, the visuospatial sketchpad, and LTM into coherent episodes.<sup>8</sup> Evidence from dual-task paradigms, where individuals perform two tasks simultaneously, and studies of patients with cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease (which can affect central executive functioning), have provided support for the distinct components of this model.<sup>7</sup></p>
                <p>An alternative perspective on WM is offered by Cowan's embedded-processes model. This model views WM not as a set of separate modules but as activated portions of LTM that are currently within the focus of attention.<sup>2</sup> Cowan's model typically includes four main elements: the central executive (similar in function to Baddeley's), LTM itself, a subset of LTM that is in a state of temporary activation, and a highly limited focus of attention, which can hold approximately 4±1 independent items.<sup>8</sup> This model emphasizes the critical role of attention in determining WM capacity and highlights the close interplay between WM and LTM.</p>
                <p>The evolution from the MSM's conceptualization of STM as a somewhat static container to the dynamic "workspace" proposed by WM models represents a significant shift in understanding short-term information processing. This was not merely an addition of more components but a fundamental reconceptualization of memory as an active, resource-dependent system. The introduction of the central executive in Baddeley's model, for instance, underscores this move towards active control and regulation. Cowan's model further blurs the distinction between short-term and long-term storage by proposing that WM consists of temporarily activated LTM representations. This progression suggests that a comprehensive understanding of memory necessitates a focus not only on where information might be stored but, more importantly, on how it is actively processed, transformed, integrated, and utilized in real-time to support ongoing cognitive activities. This emphasis on dynamic processes paves the way for more sophisticated computational models and theories that prioritize interaction, control, and the allocation of cognitive resources.</p>

                <h3 id="ltm-systems" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">2.2. Long-Term Memory (LTM): Systems and Processes</h3>
                <p>Long-Term Memory, far from being a single, monolithic entity, is now understood as a complex set of distinct but interacting systems, each specialized for different types of information and operating through different neural mechanisms. A primary distinction is made between explicit (declarative) memory, which involves conscious recollection, and implicit (non-declarative) memory, where past experiences influence behavior without conscious awareness.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p><strong>Explicit (Declarative) Memory</strong> refers to memories that can be consciously recalled and verbally expressed. It is further subdivided into:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Episodic Memory:</strong> Introduced by Endel Tulving in 1972, episodic memory pertains to the recollection of personal experiences and specific events.<sup>1</sup> These memories are often "time-stamped," tied to a particular moment and context, and can include rich details such as emotions, settings, and sensory experiences.<sup>9</sup> Examples include remembering one's first day of school or what one had for breakfast. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are key brain regions involved in episodic memory.<sup>9</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Semantic Memory:</strong> Also conceptualized by Tulving, semantic memory encompasses general knowledge and facts about the world, such as knowing that Paris is the capital of France or understanding the meaning of words.<sup>1</sup> Unlike episodic memory, semantic memories are typically not tied to a specific personal experience or point in time and are shared knowledge.<sup>9</sup> The anterior temporal lobe is particularly implicated in semantic memory processing.<sup>9</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>While distinct, episodic and semantic memory systems are highly interdependent.<sup>3</sup> Semantic knowledge often provides a framework that aids in the encoding and organization of new episodic memories (e.g., knowing the rules of a game helps in remembering a specific match). Conversely, repeated episodic experiences can contribute to the formation of new semantic knowledge (e.g., repeatedly encountering a specific animal in different contexts can lead to general knowledge about that animal). Retrieval in one system can also be facilitated by the other. Neuropsychological evidence from patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia, who often show severe episodic memory impairment with relatively preserved semantic memory, and patients with semantic dementia, who exhibit the opposite pattern (impaired semantic memory with relatively spared episodic memory, especially for recent events), supports both the distinction and the interaction between these two systems.<sup>3</sup></p>
                <p><strong>Implicit (Non-Declarative) Memory</strong> influences thoughts and behaviors without conscious awareness or intentional recall.<sup>1</sup> Key forms include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Procedural Memory:</strong> This refers to the memory for skills and habits, such as riding a bicycle, typing, or playing a musical instrument.<sup>1</sup> It is often described as "knowing how" rather than "knowing that." The cerebellum and basal ganglia are crucial for the acquisition and execution of procedural memories.<sup>10</sup> Tulving's original LTM model was criticized for initially overlooking this important memory system.<sup>9</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Classical Conditioning (Pavlovian Memory):</strong> This involves learning associations between stimuli, where a neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally elicits that response.<sup>2</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond the categorization of LTM, the processes by which memories become stable and enduring are critical. <strong>Memory Consolidation</strong> refers to these processes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Synaptic Consolidation:</strong> This is a relatively rapid process occurring at the level of individual synapses. It involves molecular and cellular changes, including the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, that strengthen synaptic connections and enable them to retain this increased strength for extended periods, from minutes to potentially years.<sup>11</sup> A key cellular mechanism believed to underlie synaptic consolidation is Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a persistent enhancement of synaptic transmission following high-frequency stimulation.<sup>12</sup> This process allows relevant memories to be stabilized within specific synapses, making them more resistant to interference from newly formed memories.<sup>11</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Systems Consolidation:</strong> This is a slower, more protracted process that involves the gradual reorganization and transfer of memory representations across different brain regions.<sup>14</sup> Classically, it describes the phenomenon where memories, initially dependent on the hippocampus for encoding and retrieval, are progressively reorganized and stored in the neocortex, eventually becoming independent of the hippocampus. This transfer helps explain Ribot's Law, which states that older memories are generally more resistant to disruption (e.g., from brain injury) than more recent memories.<sup>14</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>A more recent proposal within the framework of systems consolidation is <strong>Recall-Gated Consolidation</strong>. This theory suggests a mechanism whereby the long-term memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with, and can be reliably recalled by, the short-term memory system.<sup>15</sup> This acts as a filter, shielding long-term storage from spurious or unreliable information and focusing on signals that are consistently reinforced, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of stored memories.<sup>15</sup></p>
                <p>The initial view of LTM as a vast, undifferentiated repository, as implied by early models like the MSM <sup>6</sup>, has given way to a much more nuanced understanding. Tulving's seminal work <sup>3</sup> was instrumental in highlighting that LTM is composed of distinct systems, each with unique characteristics, content, and neural substrates. The concept of consolidation, encompassing both rapid synaptic changes <sup>11</sup> and slower, large-scale systems interactions <sup>15</sup>, further adds a dynamic dimension, illustrating that memories are not merely passively stored but are actively stabilized, transformed, and reorganized over time. The observed interdependence between systems like episodic and semantic memory <sup>3</sup> underscores that even these differentiated components interact and influence one another. This multifaceted and dynamic nature of LTM implies that memory impairments are unlikely to manifest as global failures but rather as deficits affecting specific systems or processes. Furthermore, it suggests that strategies aimed at memory enhancement might need to be tailored to the particular type of memory or the specific stage of processing (e.g., encoding, consolidation, or retrieval). The idea of recall-gated consolidation <sup>15</sup> introduces an even more sophisticated layer of dynamic control, suggesting selective mechanisms for determining what information ultimately achieves permanent storage.</p>

                <h3 id="computational-perspectives" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">2.3. Computational Perspectives on Memory</h3>
                <p>Computational models offer valuable tools for formalizing theories of memory, allowing researchers to simulate cognitive processes and test hypotheses about how information is represented, stored, and retrieved.</p>
                <p><strong>Connectionist Models</strong>, also known as neural network models or Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models, attempt to simulate cognitive functions by mimicking the massively interconnected networks of neurons in the brain.<sup>16</sup> In these models, processing involves the propagation of activation among simple, neuron-like units (nodes) that are linked by weighted connections, analogous to synapses.<sup>16</sup> Knowledge is not stored in a specific location but is distributed across the network, encoded in the pattern and strength (weights) of these connections.<sup>18</sup> Learning in connectionist models typically occurs through algorithms, such as backpropagation or the delta rule, which iteratively adjust the connection weights based on experience or feedback, allowing the network to adapt and improve its performance on tasks.<sup>17</sup> Representations of items or concepts are often distributed patterns of activation across many units, rather than being localized to a single unit.<sup>18</sup> This distributed nature makes connectionist models robust, enabling them to handle noisy or incomplete input and to exhibit properties like pattern completion and generalization.<sup>17</sup> They have been particularly effective in modeling processes such as pattern recognition, language comprehension, and memory recall, and have significantly influenced the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.<sup>17</sup></p>
                <p>Another important computational framework, particularly relevant to information retrieval, is that of <strong>Key-Value Memory Systems</strong>. These systems draw a distinction between the representations used for storage (the "values") and the representations used for retrieval (the "keys").<sup>19</sup> This separation addresses the potentially distinct computational demands of efficiently storing content and accurately accessing it later. In such a system, memoranda (inputs to be remembered) are transformed into two distinct representations: keys, which function as memory addresses, and values, which store the actual memory content.<sup>19</sup> Both keys and values are stored in memory. During retrieval, a cue is used to generate a key, which then allows access to the corresponding value. A notable feature proposed for biological key-value systems is that the brain uses keys to recall values, but it cannot consciously recall the keys themselves.<sup>19</sup> This framework suggests a division of labor in the brain, with a proposed key storage system in the medial temporal lobe and a value storage system in the neocortex.<sup>19</sup> Key-value memory models connect ideas from psychology, neuroscience, and modern machine learning, underscoring the view that effective information retrieval is a critical component of intelligence, both natural and artificial.<sup>19</sup> This perspective also posits that memories might be stored indelibly but are subject to retrieval interference, with keys being optimized for discriminability (to uniquely address memories) and values optimized for fidelity (to accurately represent content).<sup>19</sup></p>
                <p>These computational approaches shift the conceptualization of memory beyond simple static storage. Both connectionist models <sup>17</sup> and key-value systems <sup>19</sup> emphasize the dynamic processes involved in accessing and reconstructing information. Key-value systems, in particular, explicitly frame memory performance as an addressing and querying problem: how does the retrieval system keep track of storage locations, and how does it map sensory cues to these addresses?<sup>19</sup> This contrasts with earlier, simpler metaphors of memory as a library where one simply finds a book. Instead, these models evoke a database metaphor, focusing on how specific data can be efficiently queried and retrieved based on cues. Connectionist models demonstrate how patterns can be completed or "cleaned up" from partial or noisy cues through the network's dynamics, settling into an attractor state representing a stored memory.<sup>18</sup> The assertion that "there is no decisive evidence that information, once stored, is ever permanently lost" but is instead subject to "retrieval interference" <sup>19</sup> places the primary explanatory burden for forgetting and memory failures on the mechanisms of retrieval rather than on a decay or loss of the stored information itself. This perspective aligns well with common human experiences, such as the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon, where a memory feels inaccessible but can be suddenly recalled with the right cue. It suggests that efforts to improve memory might be more fruitfully directed towards optimizing retrieval strategies and cueing mechanisms rather than solely focusing on increasing storage capacity. This also finds strong parallels in how modern artificial intelligence systems are designed to handle and query vast datasets.</p>

                <p>Understanding memory necessitates identifying the brain structures and cellular mechanisms that support its diverse functions. Research has pinpointed several key brain regions that play specialized roles in different aspects of memory, as well as fundamental cellular processes that enable learning and synaptic change.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Brain Structures:</strong></p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>The Hippocampus</strong>, located within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), is critically involved in the formation of new explicit memories, particularly episodic memories (memories for events) and spatial navigation.<sup>10</sup> It plays a crucial role in converting short-term memories into long-term ones through the process of consolidation.<sup>10</sup> Damage to the hippocampus, famously illustrated by the case of patient H.M., can result in severe anterograde amnesia—the inability to form new lasting memories—while often leaving older memories and implicit memory functions relatively intact.<sup>10</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>The Amygdala</strong>, situated near the hippocampus, is central to processing the emotional significance of experiences and plays a key role in the formation and storage of emotional memories.<sup>10</sup> It works in concert with the hippocampus to modulate the encoding and consolidation of emotionally charged events, often making them more vivid and memorable than neutral ones.<sup>10</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)</strong> is extensively involved in working memory—the active maintenance and manipulation of information for ongoing tasks.<sup>2</sup> It also contributes to higher-order executive functions related to LTM, such as strategic retrieval, organization of information, source monitoring (remembering the context in which a memory was acquired), and prospective memory (remembering to perform actions in the future).<sup>10</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>The Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia</strong> are primarily associated with implicit memory, particularly procedural memory—the learning and execution of motor skills and habits.<sup>2</sup> The cerebellum is involved in fine-tuning motor control and coordination learned through practice, while the basal ganglia are crucial for the formation of habits and stimulus-response associations.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Neocortex</strong>, the brain's outer layer, is considered the primary site for the long-term storage of many types of memories, especially semantic memory (general knowledge) and, following systems consolidation, episodic memories.<sup>15</sup> Specific regions within the neocortex, such as the anterior temporal lobe for semantic memory <sup>9</sup> and various association cortices for distributed aspects of episodic memories, are implicated. The temporal association cortex, for instance, has been shown to be involved in language-related memory retrieval and exhibits coupled ripple oscillations with the MTL during successful recall.<sup>20</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Broader <strong>fronto-parietal networks</strong>, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and cingulate cortex, are consistently activated during demanding working memory tasks, reflecting their roles in attention, manipulation, and maintenance of information.<sup>2</sup> Subcortical regions, including parts of the midbrain and cerebellum, also contribute to working memory functions.<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p><strong>Cellular Mechanisms:</strong></p>
                <p>At the cellular level, <strong>Synaptic Plasticity</strong>—the ability of synapses (the connections between neurons) to strengthen or weaken over time in response to changes in neural activity—is widely considered the fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory.<sup>11</sup></p>
                <p>One of the most extensively studied forms of synaptic plasticity is <strong>Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)</strong>. LTP refers to a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons that results from stimulating them synchronously.<sup>12</sup> It is widely accepted as a crucial cellular correlate of memory formation, providing a plausible mechanism for how experience can lead to enduring changes in neural circuits.<sup>13</sup></p>
                <p>The investigation of memory's neurobiological basis, from early lesion studies like those involving patient H.M. <sup>11</sup> to modern neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques, has revealed a complex and distributed system. While specific structures like the hippocampus are undeniably critical for certain memory functions <sup>10</sup>, it is clear that memory is not localized to a single "memory center." Instead, different types of memory (e.g., episodic vs. procedural) and different memory processes (e.g., encoding vs. retrieval vs. consolidation) rely on distinct yet interacting neural circuits and brain regions.<sup>2</sup> Even the formation and recall of a single, rich episodic memory likely involves coordinated activity across the hippocampus, amygdala (if emotionally salient), prefrontal cortex, and various neocortical areas. The concept of systems consolidation explicitly describes a dynamic shift in the neural representation of memories over time, further highlighting this distributed and interactive nature.<sup>15</sup> This distribution implies that brain damage or dysfunction can lead to highly specific memory deficits depending on the location and extent of the pathology. It also suggests that memory emerges from the orchestrated activity of widespread neural networks, a complexity that makes a complete understanding challenging but also offers multiple potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating memory disorders. Recent findings, such as the observation of "coupled ripples" – synchronized high-frequency oscillations – between the medial temporal lobe and the temporal association cortex during successful verbal memory retrieval, provide direct electrophysiological evidence for this kind of dynamic, network-level coordination underlying memory processes.<sup>20</sup></p>

                <p>While mainstream neuroscience and psychology have made significant strides in understanding the behavioral and neurobiological correlates of memory, some researchers and theorists have turned to the principles of quantum mechanics to explore deeper, potentially more fundamental aspects of consciousness and, by extension, memory. This section examines the precedents for quantum effects in biology, the challenges involved, specific quantum theories of consciousness with implications for memory, and the limitations of classical physics that motivate such inquiries.</p>

                <h3 id="quantum-effects-bio" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">3.1. Quantum Effects in Biological Systems: Precedents and Challenges</h3>
                <p>The field of quantum biology investigates the possibility that quantum mechanical phenomena, beyond their foundational role in basic chemistry, play functionally significant roles in biological processes.<sup>21</sup> Several examples have emerged where quantum effects are thought to be crucial:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> The remarkable efficiency of energy transfer in photosynthetic complexes (up to 99% in some bacteria) has been proposed to involve quantum coherence, allowing excitation energy to explore multiple pathways simultaneously via quantum walks, rather than classical random walks, to find the most efficient route to the reaction center.<sup>21</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Vision:</strong> The initial step of vision, the absorption of a photon by a retinal molecule leading to its isomerization, is inherently a quantum or at least semi-classical process, involving the quantization of energy states.<sup>21</sup> While this process itself may not require sustained coherence or entanglement in the same way as proposed for photosynthesis, it demonstrates the direct interaction of quantum entities (photons) with biological molecules to initiate a physiological response.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avian Magnetoreception:</strong> The ability of some birds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field is hypothesized to involve quantum effects, specifically long-lived entangled radical pairs in cryptochrome proteins within the bird's retina. The orientation of these quantum spins relative to the magnetic field could influence chemical reactions, providing a directional cue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These examples establish that biological systems can, and in some cases do, harness quantum phenomena. However, extending these principles to complex cognitive functions like memory faces significant challenges. Biological systems are typically characterized as warm, wet, and noisy environments.<sup>22</sup> These conditions are generally considered hostile to the delicate quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement, that are often invoked in quantum theories of cognition. Such states usually require extremely low temperatures and isolation from environmental interactions to prevent decoherence—the loss of quantum properties due to interaction with the environment.<sup>22</sup> Overcoming or accounting for rapid decoherence in the brain is a primary hurdle for any theory proposing a functional role for non-trivial quantum effects in processes like memory.</p>

                <h3 id="quantum-theories-consciousness" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">3.2. Quantum Theories of Consciousness and Their Implications for Memory</h3>
                <p>Several theories propose that classical mechanics and the known properties of neuronal connections are insufficient to explain consciousness, positing instead that quantum mechanical phenomena like entanglement and superposition are necessary.<sup>24</sup> If memory is intimately linked to conscious experience, then a quantum theory of consciousness could inherently provide a quantum basis for memory.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Penrose-Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR)</strong> theory is one of the most detailed and debated quantum consciousness models.<sup>22</sup> It proposes that consciousness arises from quantum computations occurring within microtubules, which are protein filaments forming part of the cytoskeleton inside brain neurons.<sup>22</sup> Microtubules are composed of tubulin protein subunits, which possess hydrophobic pockets containing delocalized π electrons, suggested as suitable sites for quantum coherent behavior.<sup>24</sup> Hameroff has argued that microtubules can act as quantum computers, orchestrating these quantum computations.<sup>22</sup> The conscious moment, in this theory, corresponds to Roger Penrose's concept of Objective Reduction (OR) – a proposed self-collapse of the quantum wave function (superposition of states) that occurs when a gravitational threshold related to spacetime geometry instability at the Planck scale is reached.<sup>22</sup> This OR event is considered neither random (as in standard quantum measurement due to environmental decoherence) nor fully deterministic, but is influenced by non-computable factors embedded in the fundamental structure of spacetime geometry.<sup>25</sup> Recent experimental findings announced in 2022 have provided some evidence suggestive of quantum processes operating within microtubules at biological temperatures, lending tentative support to some aspects of the model.<sup>24</sup></p>
                <p><strong>Memory Implication (Inferred):</strong> The Orch OR theory primarily focuses on the generation of conscious experience. If each conscious moment is an Orch OR event, then memories could potentially be encoded in the classical outcomes of these quantum computations (the specific state chosen after collapse) or in the physical alterations to microtubule structures (e.g., patterns of tubulin states) resulting from these sequences of quantum events. Memory, in this view, would be a byproduct or an integral part of the stream of conscious moments generated by these quantum processes.</p>
                <p>Other <strong>Quantum Mind Ideas</strong> have also been proposed:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Eugene Wigner suggested that the wave function collapses due to its interaction with consciousness, implying a fundamental role for the conscious observer in shaping physical reality.<sup>24</sup></li>
                    <li>Hiroomi Umezawa and collaborators developed a quantum field theory approach to memory storage, suggesting that memories might be stored as ordered states in a quantum field within the brain.<sup>24</sup></li>
                    <li>Giuseppe Vitiello and Walter Freeman proposed a "dialog model" of the mind, involving an interplay between classical and quantum aspects of brain dynamics.<sup>24</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These theories attempt to address the "hard problem" of consciousness—how physical processes give rise to subjective experience. The connection to memory often arises because memory retrieval is typically a conscious experience, and the contents of memory are often the contents of past conscious states. Thus, a quantum explanation for consciousness might naturally extend to encompass memory.</p>

                <h3 id="quantum-principles-memory" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">3.3. How Quantum Principles Might Underpin Memory Processes</h3>
                <p>Beyond specific theories of quantum consciousness, general quantum principles offer intriguing, albeit speculative, possibilities for how memory processes might be underpinned:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Quantum Information Processing:</strong> Quantum mechanics provides fundamentally different ways to represent and process information compared to classical systems. Qubits, the quantum analogue of classical bits, can exist in superpositions of 0 and 1, and multiple qubits can be entangled, meaning their states are correlated in ways that have no classical counterpart.<sup>26</sup> This allows for massive parallelism and novel computational capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Quantum Memories:</strong> In the context of quantum technology, "quantum memories" are devices designed to store the quantum state of photons (or other quantum systems) by mapping them onto stationary matter states and preserving them for subsequent retrieval.<sup>26</sup> These are crucial components for developing quantum computers and long-distance quantum communication networks.<sup>26</sup> While these engineered systems are distinct from biological memory, they demonstrate the physical principle of storing and retrieving quantum information, often involving light-matter interactions and the use of specific atomic or solid-state systems with suitable energy level structures (e.g., Λ-level systems) and control protocols (e.g., Electromagnetically Induced Transparency - EIT).<sup>26</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Speculative Connections to Biological Memory:</strong></p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Entanglement:</strong> Could entanglement play a role in associative memory, allowing for the non-local linking of disparate pieces of information that form a single memory episode? Could it mediate the binding of different features of a memory (visual, auditory, emotional) into a coherent whole?</li>
                    <li><strong>Superposition:</strong> Could the brain utilize superposition to simultaneously explore multiple memory traces or potential interpretations of a retrieval cue, collapsing to a specific memory upon conscious recognition?</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Capacity:</strong> The potential information storage capacity of quantum states is vastly greater than that of classical bits. If biological systems could harness even a fraction of this capacity, it could offer a means for storing the immense amount of information accumulated over a lifetime.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is crucial to emphasize that these are largely hypothetical extensions of quantum principles to the domain of biological memory. Direct empirical evidence for such quantum mechanisms operating in memory encoding, storage, or retrieval in the brain is currently lacking.</p>

                <h3 id="limitations-classical-physics" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">3.4. Limitations of Classical Physics and Standard Quantum Theory in Explaining Cognitive Phenomena</h3>
                <p>The motivation for exploring quantum approaches to consciousness and memory often stems from perceived limitations in classical physics and, to some extent, standard interpretations of quantum theory, when applied to the complexities of the mind and brain.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Classical Physics and Mental Causation:</strong> Classical physics, particularly the deterministic worldview that emerged from 19th-century mechanics, tends to view the brain as a complex machine operating according to local physical laws acting on material particles and fields. In such a framework, there is often no clear causal role for subjective mental states like "feeling," "knowing," or "effort"; they are typically seen as epiphenomena or reducible to underlying physical processes.<sup>28</sup> This perspective is rooted in ideas about the natural world that have been known to be fundamentally incomplete since the advent of quantum mechanics.<sup>28</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>The Causal Efficacy of Conscious Will:</strong> A significant challenge for purely mechanistic, classical models is to account for the apparent causal efficacy of conscious will or effort in altering brain processes and behavior, as observed in phenomena like self-directed neuroplasticity (where focused mental effort can change brain structure and function).<sup>28</sup> Standard quantum theory, particularly interpretations that involve the observer or conscious choice in the process of wave function collapse, offers a conceptual framework where conscious effort might play a more direct causal role in influencing physical brain states.<sup>28</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Quantum Dynamics at the Neuronal Level:</strong> It has been argued that the classical approximation may not even be sufficient to describe certain critical processes at the neuronal level, such as the dynamics of ion channels, which are essential for synaptic function and neuronal excitability. The small size and specific quantum mechanical properties of these channels might necessitate a full quantum dynamical treatment.<sup>28</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Underestimation of Biological Computational Capacity:</strong> The computational capacities of neurons, and even aneural organisms like bacteria and fungi, might be significantly underestimated if one considers only classical information channels, such as ionic flows and action potentials, which operate at speeds around 10<sup>3</sup> operations per second.<sup>23</sup> The discovery of quantum optical properties in cytoskeletal filaments (like microtubules) has led to proposals of vastly higher information processing capacities within biological systems if quantum channels are utilized.<sup>23</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These limitations and perceived explanatory gaps in classical and some standard quantum approaches provide a strong impetus for seeking alternative frameworks. These may include more sophisticated interpretations of quantum mechanics or, as explored in the next section, entirely new physical theories like TGD, which aim to provide a more comprehensive account of consciousness, cognition, and their physical instantiation, including memory.</p>
                <p>A crucial observation when considering the role of quantum mechanics in biological memory is that most proposals, such as Orch OR <sup>22</sup> or Wigner's ideas on consciousness and collapse <sup>24</sup>, are primarily theories of quantum consciousness. Memory often enters the picture as a secondary consequence or an associated feature of these conscious processes. Direct, well-supported quantum models specifically detailing biological memory encoding, storage, and retrieval mechanisms that are distinct from overarching theories of consciousness are relatively scarce in the current literature (Umezawa's quantum field theory of memory storage is an exception noted in <sup>24</sup>, but is not extensively detailed in the provided materials). The "quantum memories" developed in physics <sup>26</sup> are technological artifacts, not biological systems.</p>
                <p>The general line of argument often proceeds as follows: 1) Classical physics appears inadequate to explain the subjective nature of consciousness.<sup>28</sup> 2) Quantum mechanics possesses features (like superposition, entanglement, and the role of the observer/measurement) that seem to offer more explanatory power or resonate with aspects of thought and experience. 3) Therefore, consciousness itself might be a macroscopic quantum phenomenon. 4) Memory is intimately linked with conscious experience (e.g., recall is often a conscious event, and memories are of past conscious states). 5) Consequently, memory might also have a quantum basis. The primary target of explanation in these theories is typically consciousness, and memory is often included due to its close association. This implies that the "support" of current quantum ontology for biological memory is largely indirect and heavily contingent on the validity and empirical substantiation of these quantum consciousness theories. If consciousness is ultimately found not to be a fundamentally quantum process, the rationale for invoking quantum mechanics for memory (beyond basic molecular interactions) would be considerably weakened, unless direct quantum mechanisms specific to information storage and retrieval in biological tissues—independent of grand theories of consciousness—are discovered and verified. The significant challenge lies in moving from the assertion that "quantum phenomena could be involved" to demonstrating that "quantum phenomena are demonstrably involved in memory in this specific, functionally relevant way."</p>

                <p>Several core concepts within TGD are foundational to its model of consciousness and memory:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Ontological Basis – Spacetime as a 4-Surface:</strong> TGD aims to unify General Relativity with Standard Model particle physics by geometrizing fundamental interactions.<sup>29</sup> It posits that physical spacetime is not an abstract 4-dimensional manifold but a 4-dimensional surface embedded within a higher-dimensional space, specifically an 8-dimensional space H = M<sup>4</sup> × CP<sup>2</sup>, where M<sup>4</sup> is the 4-D Minkowski space (the spacetime of special relativity) and CP<sup>2</sup> is a complex projective space of 2 complex (4 real) dimensions.<sup>29</sup> This embedding leads to the concept of a "many-sheeted spacetime," where multiple spacetime surfaces can coexist, interact, and form complex topological structures.<sup>31</sup> Topological field quantization is another key outcome, implying that classical fields (like electromagnetic fields) are quantized into particle-like entities (e.g., flux tubes) associated with these spacetime sheets.<sup>32</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Energy Ontology (ZEO)</strong>: This is a cornerstone of TGD's quantum theory. In ZEO, physical states are not defined at a single instant of time but are "zero energy states" existing between two 3-dimensional boundaries within a Causal Diamond (CD).<sup>31</sup> A CD is defined as the intersection of a future-directed and a past-directed light-cone in M<sup>4</sup>. The positive energy part of the state resides at the future boundary of the CD, and the negative energy part resides at the past boundary, with the net quantum numbers of the state summing to zero.<sup>31</sup> Quantum jumps (State Function Reductions - SFRs) occur between these entire zero energy states, effectively re-creating the universe (or a sub-universe associated with a self) with each jump.<sup>33</sup> Crucially, in TGD, a quantum jump is identified as a moment of consciousness.<sup>32</sup> ZEO also implies the existence of two distinct times: geometric time (the standard time coordinate of the physicist, associated with the 4-D spacetime surface) and subjective time (the sequence of quantum jumps experienced by a conscious entity, or "self").<sup>31</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchy of Planck Constants (h<sub>eff</sub>)</strong>: TGD proposes that Planck's constant, h, is not a universal fixed value but can have a spectrum of values, h<sub>eff</sub> = n × h<sub>0</sub>, where h<sub>0</sub> is the standard Planck constant and n is an integer.<sup>34</sup> These larger values of h<sub>eff</sub> are associated with phases of matter referred to as "dark matter" in the TGD sense (not necessarily identical to cosmological dark matter, though connections are proposed). These phases are crucial for enabling macroscopic quantum coherence in biological systems, even at physiological temperatures.<sup>30</sup> The value of h<sub>eff</sub> is interpreted as a measure of algebraic complexity, representative capacity, and intelligence, with larger h<sub>eff</sub> corresponding to longer quantum coherence times and lengths.<sup>5</sup> This hierarchy is considered essential for understanding consciousness, memory, and biological organization across various scales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic Bodies (MBs)</strong>: Associated with any physical system (including biological organisms, cells, and even biomolecules) are "field bodies," primarily magnetic bodies, but also electric and gravitational bodies.<sup>5</sup> These MBs are composed of dark matter/particles (phases with large h<sub>eff</sub>) and are organized into networks of magnetic flux tubes and sheets.<sup>5</sup> In TGD-inspired biology, MBs are considered higher-level intentional agents that use the physical (biological) body as a sensory receptor and motor instrument.<sup>20</sup> They play a pivotal role in consciousness, memory formation and recall, and the control and coordination of biological processes, often through resonant interactions using dark photons.</li>
                    <li><strong>p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention</strong>: TGD extends the number field underlying physics beyond real numbers to include p-adic numbers.<sup>32</sup> For every prime number p, there is a corresponding p-adic number field, which provides a different way to complete the rational numbers (analogous to how real numbers complete them). In TGD, p-adic spacetime regions (or sheets) are interpreted as physical correlates of cognition, imagination, intention, and planning.<sup>32</sup> Real spacetime regions correspond to sensory experience and the physical world, while p-adic regions represent the "mind stuff" or cognitive models of that world.<sup>32</sup> The transformation of intention (a p-adic representation) into action (a real physical process) is proposed to occur via quantum jumps involving p-adic-to-real phase transitions.<sup>32</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These highly interconnected and unconventional concepts form the bedrock of TGD's unique approach to physics and provide the necessary theoretical machinery for its distinctive model of memory, which views memory not merely as stored data but as a dynamic, conscious process embedded within a 4-dimensional reality.</p>

                <h3 id="tgd-model-memory" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">4.2. The TGD Model of Memory: A 4-Dimensional, Conscious Process</h3>
                <p>Building upon its core tenets, TGD proposes a model of memory that is fundamentally different from both mainstream neurobiological accounts and standard quantum mechanical speculations.</p>
                <p><strong>Memory as a 4-Dimensional Construct in ZEO – The "4D Brain":</strong></p>
                <p>A central idea in TGD's ZEO is that quantum states are not 3-D snapshots at a given moment but are superpositions of entire 4-dimensional spacetime surfaces, which are analogous to Bohr orbits for 3-surfaces (the TGD counterparts of particles).<sup>4</sup> This has profound implications for memory. Instead of being solely stored in the 3-D configuration of brain structures at the present moment, memory is fundamentally encoded in the 4-dimensional history or trajectory of the spacetime surface associated with the conscious entity (the "self").<sup>4</sup> This concept of a "4-dimensional brain" implies that past experiences are, in a very real sense, still part of the extended spacetime reality of the self, not just faded traces in a 3-D neural substrate.</p>
                <p>Subjective memories are understood as being about previous conscious experiences, which in TGD are identified with quantum jumps (SFRs). The information pertaining to the initial state (in the 3-D sense at the past boundary of a CD) and the final state (in the 3-D sense at the future boundary of a CD) of a quantum jump, as well as the transition itself, is proposed to be coded into the 4-D Bohr orbit (the spacetime surface) of the new zero energy state that results from that quantum jump.<sup>4</sup> This encoding is made possible by the slight non-determinism of the classical field equations (specifically, the Kähler action) that govern the dynamics of spacetime surfaces in TGD. This non-determinism ensures that the 4-D spacetime surface is sufficiently rich to carry information about the sequence of past quantum jumps, rather than being a single, uniquely determined history from initial conditions.<sup>4</sup> This contrasts sharply with standard quantum theory, where the current quantum state typically does not retain any "memory" of the previous quantum jumps that led to it.<sup>4</sup></p>
                <p><strong>The Role of Magnetic Bodies and Holographic Principles in Memory Encoding and Retrieval:</strong></p>
                <p>The Magnetic Body (MB) is not just a passive field but an active agent in TGD's model of memory, as well as in sensory perception and motor action.<sup>20</sup> A key mechanism proposed for these processes is based on holographic principles:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Encoding/Sensory Perception:</strong> The MB is thought to send out "reference beams," likely composed of dark photons (photons with a large effective Planck constant h<sub>eff</sub>), which travel along magnetic flux tubes. These reference beams interfere with "object beams," which represent sensory input that has been transformed into dark photons at the sensory organs and propagated to the brain (or other relevant biological structures).<sup>20</sup> The interference pattern of these beams creates a hologram—a sensory representation or a memory trace—on the "living matter substrate" (e.g., neural networks in the brain).<sup>20</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Recall:</strong> To recall a memory, the MB is proposed to send phase conjugates of the original reference beams (or beams related to them) towards the geometric past, to interact with the stored holographic memory trace (or its time-reversed conjugate, H̄).<sup>20</sup> This interaction is thought to generate a time-reversed mental image in the geometric past. This past mental image is then, through further processes involving state function reductions, "reflected" or communicated to the present conscious experience of the self.<sup>20</sup> The coupled ripple oscillations observed in neurophysiological studies between the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) and the temporal association cortex during successful memory retrieval <sup>20</sup> are interpreted within TGD as potential empirical correlates of this holographic recall process, possibly reflecting the "reading" of the hologram by the MB.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>State Function Reductions (SFRs) and the Flow of Subjective Time:</strong></p>
                <p>The dynamics of consciousness and the experience of time are intimately linked to SFRs in TGD:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>"Small" State Function Reductions (SSFRs):</strong> These occur repeatedly and preserve the arrow of geometric time. A sequence of SSFRs constitutes a "self" and defines its subjective flow of time.<sup>31</sup> During SSFRs, the "active" boundary of the Causal Diamond (CD) associated with the self shifts towards the geometric future, and the quantum states at this boundary change, representing the evolving experience of the self.<sup>31</sup> Sensory perception is primarily associated with sequences of SSFRs.<sup>20</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>"Big" State Function Reductions (BSRs):</strong> These are more profound events that involve a change in the arrow of geometric time for the self (or a sub-self in the hierarchy of selves).<sup>31</sup> In a BSR, the roles of the active and passive boundaries of the CD are reversed; the self effectively "dies" and is "reincarnated" as a time-reversed self.<sup>20</sup> BSRs are considered fundamental for motor action (which is seen as a time-reversed sensory perception initiated in the geometric past of a sub-self) and for the conscious recall of memories.<sup>20</sup> Memory recall involves accessing information from the geometric past, and BSRs provide the mechanism for bringing this past information into the present conscious awareness, effectively bridging different temporal perspectives.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The TGD model portrays memory not as a passive playback of stored data, but as an active, constructive process of re-experiencing, or at least re-accessing, aspects of the 4-dimensional past. This process is intrinsically linked to consciousness (quantum jumps) and the manipulation of the arrow of time (via BSRs), orchestrated by the Magnetic Body. The ZEO framework, where information from past quantum jumps is coded into the very fabric of the new 4-D spacetime state <sup>4</sup>, is central to this view. This is a significant departure from standard computer metaphors of memory involving simple storage and lookup of data files. TGD's conception of memory is more akin to a "re-living" or "re-accessing" of a segment of one's 4-dimensional reality, mediated by the MB's interaction with these spacetime records. The involvement of BSRs <sup>20</sup> suggests that recalling a memory is a profound event at the level of the self, potentially involving a momentary alteration in the arrow of subjective time for a sub-self involved in the recall process. The "slight non-determinism" of the classical field equations <sup>4</sup> is crucial, as it allows the 4-D spacetime surface to be sufficiently complex and multifaceted to encode these past transitions, rather than being a single, uniquely determined history. This inherent richness contrasts with standard quantum theory, where the present state typically holds no explicit record of the sequence of previous quantum jumps.<sup>4</sup></p>
                <p>This dynamic and reconstructive model of memory could offer a novel perspective on the subjective richness and often fallible nature of episodic memory. If memory recall involves a re-activation or re-illumination of a 4-D pattern by the MB, then the "quality" or fidelity of the recalled memory might depend on factors such as the precision of the MB's "reference beam," the state of the "holographic substrate" in the brain, and the specific sequence of SFRs involved. Furthermore, this model inextricably ties memory to the broader TGD theory of consciousness, where quantum jumps are the fundamental moments of conscious experience. Memory, therefore, becomes not just an information processing task but a fundamental aspect of conscious existence within the TGD universe. The remarkable persistence of certain memories, such as vivid childhood experiences, which are often the last to fade in old age or dementia <sup>5</sup>, could potentially be explained within this framework by the enduring nature of these 4-D spacetime traces or the MB's continued ability to access and re-animate them, perhaps due to their strong initial encoding or repeated reactivation over time.</p>

                <h3 id="cognitive-correlates-tgd" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">4.3. Cognitive Correlates in TGD: p-Adic Physics and the Representation of Intentionality and Information</h3>
                <p>TGD assigns a specific physical correlate to cognition and intentionality through the introduction of p-adic physics. As mentioned, p-adic number fields are alternative completions of the rational numbers, and in TGD, spacetime regions governed by p-adic topologies are proposed to exist alongside real spacetime regions.<sup>32</sup></p>
                <p>These p-adic spacetime regions are interpreted as the physical correlates of cognition, imagination, planning, and intention.<sup>32</sup> While real spacetime regions correspond to sensory experience and the material world, p-adic regions represent the "mind stuff"—the cognitive models, thoughts, and plans related to that world.</p>
                <p>The inherent non-determinism of p-adic differential equations is a key feature. Unlike real differential equations, p-adic ones allow for solutions that are piecewise constant, depending on a finite number of p-adic digits of their arguments. This mathematical property is interpreted as providing the "freedom of imagination" and the capacity for forming cognitive representations that are not rigidly tied to sensory input.<sup>32</sup></p>
                <p>Intentions are thought to be formulated in these p-adic sectors of the TGD universe. The transformation of an intention into a physical action is proposed to occur through p-adic-to-real phase transitions, which are quantum jumps where a p-adic spacetime region is converted into a real one, or vice versa.<sup>32</sup> These transitions are considered fundamental for volitional action and biological self-organization.</p>
                <p>There is a proposed relationship or symmetry between memory representations (which are real, associated with the geometric past) and cognitive representations (which are p-adic). This could involve a duality: geometric past ↔ geometric future, and real ↔ p-adic.<sup>32</sup> This suggests that cognitive processes (p-adic) can operate on or model past experiences (real memory traces) and project future possibilities (p-adic intentions).</p>
                <p>TGD also proposes that Boolean logic and symbolic representations can have physical correlates. For instance, many-fermion states (collections of fundamental particles like quarks and leptons) can be interpreted as representing Boolean statements (e.g., the presence or absence of a fermion in a given state corresponding to TRUE or FALSE).<sup>33</sup></p>
                <p>This framework provides a physical basis within TGD for cognitive aspects of mind that are often treated abstractly in psychology or as purely algorithmic processes in computational models. It links intention, planning, and abstract thought to specific (though non-standard) physical mechanisms and connects them to the TGD models of memory and action.</p>
                <p>Mainstream models of memory, such as working memory models <sup>7</sup>, describe complex cognitive control processes (e.g., the functions of the central executive) but typically do not offer a fundamental physical substrate for "thought" or "intention" itself, beyond the patterns of neural activity that correlate with these processes. TGD attempts to fill this conceptual gap by proposing p-adic spacetime sheets as the physical correlate of the "mind stuff" underlying cognition. The idea that intentions, represented in p-adic domains, can causally influence the real physical world by transforming into actions via p-adic-to-real phase transitions <sup>32</sup> offers a novel mechanism for understanding how mental states can exert an influence on physical reality. This directly addresses some of the limitations of purely classical physical explanations for mental causation, as noted in critiques like.<sup>28</sup> If p-adic physics is indeed the correlate of cognition, then the "cognitive" aspects of memory—such as semantic understanding, reasoning about past experiences, or using memories for future planning—would involve intricate interactions between the real sectors of the TGD universe (where sensory experiences and memory traces are primarily encoded) and the p-adic sectors (where cognitive processing and modeling occur). This could provide a new avenue for modeling how we not only recall our memories but also how we think about them, interpret them, and use them to guide future behavior.</p>

                <p>The model of memory proposed by Topological Geometrodynamics is not an isolated hypothesis concerning a specific biological function. Instead, it is deeply interwoven with the foundational principles of TGD itself. Consequently, if TGD's description of memory were to be realized or empirically supported, it would carry profound implications for our understanding of fundamental physics, necessitating a significant reconceptualization of spacetime, quantum measurement, and consciousness, and predicting a range of new physical phenomena.</p>

                <h3 id="reconceptualizing-spacetime" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">5.1. Reconceptualizing Spacetime, Quantum Measurement, and Consciousness</h3>
                <p><strong>Spacetime:</strong> In TGD, spacetime ceases to be a passive, static background against which physical events unfold. Instead, it is a dynamic, many-sheeted structure with complex topological features at all scales, from the Planck length to cosmological dimensions.<sup>31</sup> The concept of the "4D brain" <sup>4</sup>, where memories are encoded within the 4-dimensional spacetime surfaces associated with conscious entities, implies that spacetime itself is the ultimate repository of experiential history. Memory, in this view, becomes an intrinsic property of the evolving geometry and topology of spacetime, fundamentally linked to the life-history of conscious selves.</p>
                <p><strong>Quantum Measurement Theory:</strong> TGD offers a radical generalization of quantum measurement theory by integrating it with a theory of consciousness.<sup>31</sup> The quantum jump (State Function Reduction - SFR), which in standard quantum mechanics is often treated as a problematic discontinuity, is identified in TGD as a moment of consciousness.<sup>32</sup> The Zero Energy Ontology (ZEO) provides a new framework for understanding SFRs, proposing that they occur between entire 4-D spacetime histories (zero energy states) associated with Causal Diamonds.<sup>31</sup> This approach aims to resolve long-standing paradoxes of standard quantum measurement theory, such as the measurement problem and the role of the observer, by making the observer (as a "self" undergoing sequences of quantum jumps) an integral part of the physical system governed by quantum laws.</p>
                <p><strong>Consciousness:</strong> TGD posits that consciousness is not merely an emergent property of complex classical computation within, for example, a neural network. Instead, it is a fundamental aspect of reality, intrinsically tied to quantum jumps, ZEO, the hierarchy of selves associated with Magnetic Bodies (MBs), and the hierarchy of effective Planck constants (h<sub>eff</sub>).<sup>5</sup> This framework implies a hierarchy of conscious entities, from elementary particles to biological organisms, social structures, and potentially even larger cosmic systems, each characterized by its own MB and typical range of h<sub>eff</sub> values.</p>
                <p>If the TGD model of memory—which relies critically on these reconceptualizations of spacetime, quantum measurement, and consciousness—were to find validation, it would compel a paradigm shift in fundamental physics. Memory would no longer be seen as solely a neurobiological phenomenon but as a direct manifestation of these deeper, underlying physical principles that govern the structure of reality and the nature of conscious experience itself.</p>

                <h3 id="predictions-new-physics" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">5.2. Predictions of New Physical Phenomena</h3>
                <p>The TGD framework, from which its memory model is derived, makes a number of predictions for new physical phenomena that deviate significantly from the Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Hierarchy of Planck Constants (h<sub>eff</sub>) / Dark Matter Hierarchy:</strong> TGD predicts the existence of phases of matter characterized by effective Planck constants (h<sub>eff</sub> = n × h<sub>0</sub>) that are integer multiples of the standard Planck constant.<sup>35</sup> These "dark matter" phases (dark in the sense of interacting weakly with ordinary matter, not necessarily cosmological dark matter) are proposed to exhibit macroscopic quantum coherence at much higher temperatures and over much longer scales than allowed by standard physics.<sup>30</sup> This hierarchy is crucial for TGD's explanation of life and consciousness, with MBs being composed of such dark matter.<sup>5</sup> Evidence for such phases could come from anomalous behavior in biological systems or condensed matter physics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Many-Sheeted Spacetime:</strong> The concept of spacetime as a many-sheeted structure implies the possibility of new types of interactions and energy transfer mechanisms between different spacetime sheets.<sup>31</sup> Topological field quantization, leading to entities like magnetic flux tubes and field bodies, suggests a fractal hierarchy of structures and interactions not envisioned in standard field theories.<sup>31</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>ZEO and Negative Energy Signals:</strong> ZEO allows for the theoretical possibility of signals, particularly those mediated by "negative energy" topological light rays (e.g., negative energy photons), propagating "backwards" in geometric time.<sup>36</sup> This unconventional concept is invoked in TGD's explanation of memory recall (as communication with the geometric past via the MB) <sup>20</sup> and potentially in other phenomena such as intentional action and remote mental interactions.<sup>33</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>p-Adic Physics and its Real Correlates:</strong> The proposal that p-adic number fields describe the physics of cognition and intention <sup>32</sup> suggests that the interface between p-adic and real physics (e.g., p-adic-to-real phase transitions associated with the transformation of intention to action) might have observable physical signatures. If cognitive processes have distinct physical correlates rooted in p-adic topologies, this could lead to new ways of studying and understanding mind-matter interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Elementary Particles and States:</strong> TGD's geometrization of the Standard Model leads to predictions for new particle states and a different understanding of particle massification. For example, TGD predicts the existence of "super-canonical quanta" which are proposed to give dominating contributions to hadron masses, differing from the explanations provided by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) alone.<sup>36</sup> It also offers a different topological distinction between fermions and gauge bosons.<sup>36</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmological Predictions:</strong> The imbeddability of Robertson-Walker cosmologies into H = M<sup>4</sup> × CP<sup>2</sup> implies that critical and over-critical cosmologies in TGD are almost unique and have a finite duration, with accelerating expansion being a natural feature without the need for a cosmological constant.<sup>36</sup> Macroscopic quantum coherence of dark matter in astrophysical scales, driven by changes in the gravitational Planck constant, is also predicted.<sup>36</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are just some examples of the new physics predicted by TGD. These predictions extend far beyond the domain of memory and consciousness, touching upon particle physics, cosmology, and condensed matter physics. The TGD model of memory is but one application of this broader theoretical framework.</p>

                <h3 id="empirical-avenues-tgd" class="scroll-mt-16 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 pt-4 -mt-4">5.3. Potential (Indirect) Empirical Avenues for TGD</h3>
                <p>Directly testing the TGD model of memory, with its reliance on concepts like Magnetic Bodies and 4D spacetime recall, is extraordinarily challenging given current experimental capabilities. However, indirect support for the TGD framework, and thus by extension its biological models, could potentially come from various empirical avenues:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Observation of Macroscopic Quantum Coherence in Unexpected Regimes:</strong> Finding robust evidence for quantum coherence in biological systems at physiological temperatures and over macroscopic scales, particularly if these phenomena cannot be adequately explained by standard physics (e.g., through conventional quantum chemistry or decoherence-resistant quantum effects), could lend support to the TGD concepts of a hierarchy of Planck constants (h<sub>eff</sub>) and the role of Magnetic Bodies in orchestrating such coherence.<sup>39</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Anomalous Biological Effects of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Electromagnetic Fields:</strong> TGD proposes that MBs interact with biological systems via ELF EM fields, using dark photons with large h<sub>eff</sub> (and thus low frequencies but potentially high energies E=h<sub>eff</sub>f). If specific, reproducible, and non-trivial biological effects of weak ELF fields are observed that defy conventional biophysical explanations, this could be interpreted as evidence for interactions with MBs.<sup>39</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Evidence for Time-Reversal Phenomena Aligning with ZEO:</strong> The ZEO framework predicts that state function reduction can appear as a deterministic time evolution for an observer with an opposite arrow of time. Experiments like those by Minev et al. (cited in <sup>39</sup>), which suggest that quantum jumps can be "caught in mid-flight" and even reversed, provide intriguing, though debated, potential support for ZEO-like dynamics at the atomic scale. Further evidence for time-reversal phenomena in quantum measurements or in self-organizing systems that appear to defy the standard arrow of entropy could bolster ZEO.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correlations Between p-Adic Mathematical Structures and Cognitive/Biological Patterns:</strong> If p-adic physics indeed underlies cognition, then it might be possible to find non-trivial correlations between mathematical structures derived from p-adic number theory (e.g., p-adic fractals, ultrametricity) and patterns observed in cognitive processes, neural activity, or even genetic regulation.<sup>39</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>The Qualitative Nature of Subjective Memory:</strong> While not a direct physical test, the very nature of subjective memory recall, particularly the vivid re-experiencing of past events, presents a profound challenge to purely mechanistic or computational models. If standard models consistently fail to account for the qualitative richness and subjective "feel" of memory, this could be seen as an "anomaly" that theories like TGD, which place consciousness at the core of their ontology, aim to address.<sup>4</sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Anomalies in Condensed Matter Physics or Astrophysics:</strong> TGD makes predictions for phenomena in areas like superconductivity (e.g., high-temperature superconductivity), quantum Hall effect, and cosmology.<sup>36</sup> Any empirical validation of TGD's core tenets in these "simpler" physical systems would significantly increase the credibility of its application to the far more complex domains of biology, consciousness, and memory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is important to note that TGD is an exceptionally vast and intricate theoretical edifice.<sup>29</sup> Deriving easily testable, unique, and "smoking gun" predictions, especially for complex biological phenomena like memory, remains a formidable challenge. Bridging its highly abstract mathematical concepts with measurable biological and psychological phenomena is a crucial ongoing task for the theory.</p>
                <p>The TGD description of memory, as outlined in Section 4.2, is not a standalone hypothesis that can be easily detached from the rest of the theory and plugged into the framework of standard physics. It relies fundamentally on TGD's unique foundational concepts, such as Zero Energy Ontology, Magnetic Bodies, the hierarchy of effective Planck constants, p-adic physics, and the many-sheeted spacetime (detailed in Section 4.1). These concepts, in turn, are TGD's proposed solutions to long-standing fundamental problems in physics, such as the energy problem in General Relativity, the quantum measurement problem, and the unification of fundamental interactions.<sup>29</sup> Therefore, the "new things TGD would bring to fundamental physics if its memory model were realized" are, in essence, the core claims and structural components of TGD itself. The memory model serves as a specific, highly complex application domain where these fundamental principles are proposed to operate in a concrete and interconnected way to produce a recognizable cognitive function.</p>
                <p>This deep integration means that the validation (or falsification) of TGD's memory model is inextricably linked to the validation of TGD as a comprehensive theory of physics. If phenomena predicted by TGD in other, perhaps more experimentally accessible, physical systems (such as anomalies in condensed matter physics <sup>39</sup> or novel cosmological observations <sup>36</sup>) were to be confirmed, it would lend significant plausibility to its more complex biological models, including its account of memory. Conversely, the radical nature of TGD's memory model—with its propositions of a 4D brain, Magnetic Bodies as the true agents of recall, and communication with the geometric past—means that it inherently predicts a physics that extends far beyond currently accepted paradigms. Its realization would thus necessitate a profound revision of our understanding of the fundamental constituents and laws of the universe.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This report has traversed a wide spectrum of perspectives on memory, from well-established psychological and neurobiological models to the speculative frontiers of quantum consciousness theories and the comprehensive, alternative physical framework of Topological Geometrodynamics. Each approach offers unique insights and faces distinct challenges in the quest to understand one of humanity's most fundamental cognitive capacities.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Integrating Diverse Understandings of Memory</h3>
                <p>The journey began with mainstream models (Section 2), which primarily focus on the "how" of memory at the psychological and neural levels. These models, from the foundational Multi-Store Model to sophisticated accounts of Working Memory, Long-Term Memory systems (episodic, semantic, procedural), consolidation processes, and computational simulations, have provided invaluable frameworks for describing memory's architecture, its component processes, and its neurobiological substrates. They detail how information is encoded, stored, and retrieved within the complex machinery of the brain.</p>
                <p>The exploration then moved to quantum approaches (Section 3), which often attempt to address the "what" of conscious experience as it relates to memory. Theories like Orch OR speculate that non-trivial quantum mechanical effects, such as superposition and entanglement occurring within neuronal structures like microtubules, might be essential for consciousness, with memory being an associated phenomenon. These theories grapple with the "hard problem" of subjective experience and seek explanations beyond classical physics, though they face significant hurdles in demonstrating functionally relevant quantum effects in the warm, wet environment of the brain.</p>
                <p>Finally, the report delved into Topological Geometrodynamics (Section 4), a theory that proposes a new fundamental physics to address the "what" and "how" of memory, consciousness, and reality itself. TGD's model, with its Zero Energy Ontology, Magnetic Bodies, hierarchy of Planck constants, and p-adic physics, paints a picture of memory as an active, 4-dimensional, conscious process orchestrated by field bodies and intrinsically linked to the fabric of spacetime. If validated, TGD's implications for fundamental physics would be transformative (Section 5).</p>
                <p>The progression of these perspectives reflects a deepening inquiry into the nature of memory. We start by asking how the brain, as a physical system, processes information to create and access memories. Dissatisfaction with purely mechanistic explanations for the subjective aspects of memory and consciousness then leads to the question of whether the fundamental nature of consciousness itself, which experiences these memories, might require the principles of quantum physics. TGD takes this inquiry further, asking whether memory, consciousness, and the very fabric of physical reality are inseparable aspects of a single, underlying (geo)dynamical framework. Each step in this progression pushes the boundaries of what is considered relevant to a full understanding of memory.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Challenges and Future Directions in the Interdisciplinary Study of Memory</h3>
                <p>Each of these broad approaches faces its own set of challenges and points towards specific future directions:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>For Mainstream Models:</strong> The primary ongoing tasks include the continued refinement of the neural correlates of different memory types and processes, a deeper understanding of the complex network dynamics that support memory functions, and the persistent challenge of bridging psychological constructs (like "working memory capacity" or "episodic recollection") with precise biological mechanisms. The "binding problem"—how disparate features of a single experience (sights, sounds, emotions, context) are integrated into a coherent memory trace and later retrieved as such—remains a significant area of research. Further integration of computational modeling with empirical data will be crucial.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Quantum Approaches:</strong> The foremost challenge is to provide clear, unambiguous, and empirically verifiable evidence of functionally relevant quantum effects in the brain that go beyond trivial quantum chemistry and are robust enough to survive the brain's noisy thermal environment.<sup>23</sup> Moving from plausible correlations or theoretical elegance to demonstrating causation in quantum consciousness theories is essential. Developing experimental paradigms that can specifically test for non-classical information processing in neural systems is a critical need.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Topological Geometrodynamics:</strong> The immense theoretical complexity of TGD and the associated difficulty in deriving easily testable, unique predictions that can distinguish it from standard physics or other alternative theories are major hurdles.<sup>29</sup> A key future direction must be the focused effort to bridge its highly abstract concepts with measurable biological and physical phenomena. Finding "smoking gun" experimental evidence for its core tenets—such as Zero Energy Ontology, the existence of a hierarchy of effective Planck constants (h<sub>eff</sub>) in biological matter, the functional role of Magnetic Bodies, or observable consequences of p-adic physics in cognitive systems—is paramount for the theory to gain wider acceptance and empirical traction.<sup>39</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Final Thoughts on the Nature of Memory</h3>
                <p>The diverse perspectives explored in this report raise fundamental questions about the nature of memory. Is memory purely an emergent property of complex neural computation, a sophisticated form of information processing within a classical physical system? Or does its intimate connection with subjective experience and consciousness hint at deeper layers of reality, perhaps involving quantum principles or even a radically new physics as suggested by TGD?</p>
                <p>The persistence of the "hard problem" of consciousness—the challenge of explaining how and why we have qualitative, subjective experiences, including the experience of remembering—suggests that purely mechanistic explanations of memory, while powerful in describing its functional aspects, may ultimately remain incomplete in accounting for its phenomenal character. The frontier of memory research arguably lies at the intersection of information, matter, and consciousness. Future breakthroughs in our understanding of memory may well require a truly consilient approach, one where insights from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, computer science, fundamental physics, and perhaps even philosophy are not merely juxtaposed but are deeply integrated into a more holistic and comprehensive theoretical framework. The very nature of the inquiry that prompted this report—spanning from established neurobiology to the frontiers of theoretical physics—is itself a testament to this growing interdisciplinary need and the enduring quest to unravel the mysteries of memory.</p>

              <dt>Many-Sheeted Spacetime:</dt>
              <dd>TGD posits a hierarchical structure of spacetime sheets, allowing for a complex interplay of physical systems at different scales. This contrasts with the single, monolithic spacetime of General Relativity.</dd>
              <dt>Zero Energy Ontology (ZEO):</dt>
              <dd>In ZEO, physical states are superpositions of histories, and quantum jumps recreate these histories. This provides a basis for understanding the flow of subjective time and intentional action.</dd>
              <dt>Hierarchy of Planck Constants:</dt>
              <dd>TGD proposes a hierarchy of effective Planck constants (h_eff = n * h), suggesting that macroscopic quantum coherence can occur at larger scales than predicted by standard quantum mechanics. This is crucial for biological systems.</dd>

              <dt>The 4D Brain & Memory Encoding:</dt>
              <dd>In ZEO, memories are not just stored in 3D neural patterns. Instead, TGD proposes a "4D brain," where the conscious history of a self is encoded in the 4-dimensional spacetime surface associated with it. Past quantum jumps (conscious moments) embed information about themselves into the geometry and topology of this 4D surface. This is possible due to the slight non-determinism of TGD's fundamental field equations (Kähler action), allowing the 4D spacetime "Bohr orbit" to be rich enough to carry historical information.</dd>
              <dt>Episodic Memories as Re-Experiences:</dt>
              <dd>Thus, episodic memories are not passive playbacks but can be actual re-experiences or a re-illumination of a segment of this 4D past. This is achieved by quantum jumping to a state where the sub-self (mental image) corresponding to the memory is briefly re-activated in the geometric past.</dd>
              <dt>Role of Magnetic Bodies (MBs) & Holographic Recall:</dt>
              <dd>The Magnetic Body (MB) is the intentional agent orchestrating memory. TGD suggests a holographic mechanism: The MB encodes memories by sending "reference beams" (e.g., dark photons) which interfere with sensory input ("object beams," also transformed into dark photons) to create holographic memory traces, likely on biological structures. For recall, the MB sends phase-conjugate reference beams towards the geometric past to interact with these stored holograms. This interaction reconstructs the memory, which is then communicated to the present conscious experience of the self.</dd>

                A "self" is a sequence of <strong>Small State Function Reductions (SSFRs)</strong>. During SSFRs, the conscious experience of the self evolves, the arrow of geometric time is preserved, and the "active" boundary of its associated Causal Diamond (CD) shifts towards the geometric future.
                For conscious memory recall, which involves accessing the geometric past, <strong>Big State Function Reductions (BSRs)</strong> are crucial. A BSR can change the arrow of geometric time for the self or a sub-self involved in the recall. This effectively allows the self to "look" into its geometric past, re-activating a past mental image.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">Appendix B. Foundational questions</h2>
    <p>There are several foundational questions involved. What is the origin of the p-adicity? What is the justification of p-adic thermodynamics and what does it have a counterpart at quantum level? What are the poorly understood aspects of p-adic thermodynamics? What is the understanding of generalized superconformal representations and possible interpretational and technical problems.</p>

    <h3 id="questions-padic-thermo" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">B.1. Questions related to the p-adic thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>The nice feature of both approaches is that the propagators carry a minimum amount of information about the quantum states at the 3-surfaces to which the end points of the propagator are associated. Therefore the construction of physical states with correct total color quantum numbers do not affect the propagators. One also circumvents the problem how to take into account the massivation by p-adic thermodynamics at the level of the fermionic propagators.</p>
    <p>This construction says nothing about how physical fermions are constructed and how the get their masses via p-adic thermodynamics.</p>

    <h4 id="origin-padic-thermo" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">B.1.1 The origin of p-adic thermodynamics</h4>
    <p>The understanding of the origin of p-adic thermodynamics is the first challenge.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In p-adic thermodynamics, the scaling generator \(L_0\) takes the role of energy as a generator of time translations. Ordinary 2-D conformal invariance requires that physical states are annihilated by \(L_0\). All states created by \(L_0\) would correspond to gauge degrees of freedom. This cannot be the case in p-adic thermodynamics.<br/>
        In TGD, the conformal algebras are replaced by half-algebras <a href="#ref-btart-wcwsymm">[wcwsymm (btart)]</a>, which allow an infinite hierarchy of sub-algebras isomorphic to the full algebra, which means that a finite-dimensional sub-algebra transforms from gauge algebra to a dynamical symmetry algebra and p-adic thermodynamics applies to states in this finite-dimensional state space.</li>
        <li>In the 2-D version of the p-adic thermodynamics, the ground state is necessarily tachyonic with a negative conformal weight representing the mass squared. The physical ground state with a vanishing mass squared is obtained by applying conformal generators with a positive conformal weight. Where do the generators with tachyonic conformal weight come from?
            <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                <li>p-Adic thermodynamics in its recent formulation <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> answers this question by extending the conformal algebra from dimension 2 to dimension 4 so that one has hypercomplex and complex coordinate and there are conformal weights associated with both of them. The 4-dimensional conformal invariance is realized in holography=holomorphy (H-H) vision involving the notion of Hamilton-Jacobi structure in an essential way <a href="#ref-brart-HJ">[HJ (brart)]</a>. There are conformal weights associated with hypercomplex resp. complex coordinates and the corresponding conformal weights are non-negative resp. negative. Their sum vanishes for massless ground states.</li>
                <li>\(M^8\)-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-TGDcritics">[TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> provides further insights to the tachyon problem. In \(M^8\), the momentum space \(M^4\) corresponds to a quaternionic subspace of octonions realized as the normal space of point y of the 4-surfaces \(Y^4 \subset M^8\). The point y carries the fermion. The 8-D mass squared always vanishes but the \(M^4\) part is in general non-vanishing. For some points \(y \in Y^4\) the normal space \(M^4\) is such that the \(E^4\) part of the 8-momentum vanishes and the particle is massless in \(M^4\) sense. This is the counterpart for the cancellation of the two conformal weights at the level of H.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="problem-superconformal" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">B.1.2 A possible problem with super-conformal representations</h4>
    <p>What about the higher conformal excitations giving rise to the p-adic thermal mass? There does not seem to be any point or need to modify the massless propagators since they are associated with the ground state of the super-conformal representations. There is however a problem.</p>
    <p>In string models the super generators \(G_n\) of Ramond representation and \(G_{n+1/2}\) of Neveu-Schwarz representation define the analog of the Dirac operator. The anticommutators \(\{G_m,G_n^\dagger\}\) and \(\{G_{m+1/2},G_{n+1/2}^\dagger\}\) give Virasoro generators \(L_n\). In the Ramond representation one has \(G_0= p^k\gamma_k +G_{vib,0}\). The Ramond representation therefore contains the ordinary Dirac operator acting in cm degrees of freedom.</p>
    <p>In p-adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-mless-padmass2022">[mless, padmass2022 (allb)]</a> based on the TGD view of conformal invariance <a href="#ref-btart-wcwsymm">[wcwsymm (btart)]</a>, the Majorana option is not possible. Since the ordinary gamma matrices do not carry a fermion number, the Ramond formula of G would involve generators with a vanishing fermion number and non-vanishing fermion number. Same applies also to \(G_n\).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>A possible solution of the problem is that super generators and their Hermitian conjugates define two kinds of supergenerators. For Ramond representation, this would also include the counterparts of ordinary gamma matrices. The algebra creating the states would involve only non-negative conformal weights and possess a fractal hierarchy of included sub-algebras isomorphic to the entire algebra.</li>
        <li>Could \(G_0\) is non-hermitian so that both \(G_0\) resp. \(G_0^\dagger\) carrying a fermion number 1 resp. -1 are allowed. The counterparts of \(M^4\) gamma matrices would be analogous to fermionic creation and annihilation operators, which would correspond to a complex structure in center-or mass degrees of freedom.<br/>
        Could the Hamilton-Jacobi structure <a href="#ref-btart-HJ">[HJ (btart)]</a> for \(M^4\) based on hyper-complex and complex structure make this possible. The conjugation for complex coordinate and its hypercomplex counterpart would correspond to the hermitian conjugation for the operators \(\gamma_u\) and \(\gamma_w\) producing \(\gamma_u^\dagger=\gamma_v\) and \(\gamma_w^\dagger=\gamma_{\bar{w}}\) for both leptonic and quark-like representations.

    <h4 id="origin-padicity" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">B.1.3 Questions related to the origin of p-adicity</h4>
    <p>One can also make ontological questions related to p-adicity.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>What is the origin of the p-adicity? H-H vision <a href="#ref-btart-Langlands2025">[Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> has led to a considerable progress in the attempts to understand the origin of p-adicity and the p-adic length scale hypothesis. The notion of functional p-adic numbers suggests how the p-adicization and adelization emerge. One can even ask whether it is necessary to introduce the p-adic and adelic variants of the embedding space in this approach.</li>
        <li>p-Adic thermodynamics is a statistical description and must be an approximation to a genuine quantal description. Quantum TGD can be formally regarded as a square root of thermodynamics at a quantum critical temperature defined by the Kähler coupling strength <a href="#ref-allb-UandM">[UandM, vNeumannnew (allb)]</a>. Could it make sense to speak of a square root of p-adic thermodynamics in which thermal probabilities correspond to quantal probabilities. Thermal state would be replaced by a quantum state. Very naively, thermodynamic weights would be replaced with their complex square roots, that is ordinary square roots involving a phase factor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="8d-relativity" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">B.2. Does 8-dimensionality imply 8-dimensional relativity?</h3>
    <p>One cannot avoid the question whether 8-dimensionality implies an 8-D generalization of relativity.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The completely new element is that at \(M^8\) level \(M^4\) as normal space is not fixed but dynamical: could one speak of relativity for mass squared? The Lorentz boosts of this relativity could correspond to the Lorentz group SO(1,7) of \(M^8\). Also \(G_2\) as a subgroup affects the \(M^4\) mass squared values since it does not leave quaternionic subspace \(M^4\) invariant although it does not affect the energy.</li>
        <li>Masslessness in the 8-D sense at \(M^8\) level forces us to challenge the assumption that the particles always have a well-defined 4-D mass squared. As a matter of fact, p-adic thermodynamics and its possible quantum variant as a square root of thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-UandM-vNeumannnew">[UandM, vNeumannnew (allb)]</a> already does this. Could one think that mass is more like a transversal or longitudinal momentum squared and depends on the state of motion characterized by the normal space of \(Y^4\)?</li>
        <li>What about color quantum numbers: could 8-D relativity apply even to them. This would change dramatically the views of color. In \(M^8\), SO(4) acting on \(E^4 \subset M^8\) is the counterpart of SU(3) acting in \(CP_2 \subset H\) and also as a subgroup \(SU(3) \subset G_2\) of octonion automorphisms leaving invariant the octonion unit defining \(M^4\) time direction in the normal space. \(M^4\) as a quaternionic normal space of \(Y^4\) varies and therefore also the subgroup \(SU(3) \subset G_2\). Suppose that one replaces normal space-with a new one by deforming \(Y^4\) such that the point \(y \in E^4\) is not affected. What happens?<br/>
        I have asked whether SO(4)-SU(3) duality between hadron physics and QCD type physics could correspond to \(M^8\)-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-M8H">[M8H1, M8H2, TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a>. Could \(M^8\)-H duality map the 2 Cartan quantum numbers of SO(4) representations appearing in \(M^8\) spinor harmonics to those of SU(3) representations of H spinor harmonics. Could the representations of SU(3) be restricted to the U(2) subgroup of the covering group of SO(4) in accordance with the left-right asymmetry of the standard model?<br/>
        Suppose that SO(1,7) and also \(G_2\) transformations affect the SO(4) representations. If so, then by \(M^8\)-H duality in the proposed form they also affect the SU(3) color partial waves for H spinors. By color confinement this is however not easy to observe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="m8-h-duality-consistency" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">B.3. Is the proposed picture consistent with \(M^8\)-H duality</h3>
    <p>\(M^8\)-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-TGDcritics-HHtwistor">[TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> plays a central role in TGD. Therefore one can also worry about whether octotwistors, which for physical states must reduce in some sense to quaternionic twistors, are a well-defined notion. The octonionic spinors must reduce to quaternionic spinors for the physical states in some sense. Massless Dirac equation must be satisfied and the analogs of the chirality conditions for H, \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) must make sense.</p>
    <p>In the sequel the massless octonionic Dirac equation will be discussed.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Octonionic and quaternionic spinors are very much analogous to the 2-spinors appearing in the definition of twistors since \(\gamma^0\) in the Dirac equation is replaced with a real octonion unit. The masslessness condition is obtained when Minkowski inner product is defined as the real part for the product of octonions. The counterparts of sigma matrices are identified as quaternions and octonions and matrix representations for the quaternionic units are not used. This allows the introduction of a commuting imaginary unit i doubling the number of degrees of freedom and replacing octospinors with their complexified counterparts.</li>
        <li>The octonionic Dirac equation looks like the ordinary Dirac equation but with gamma matrices replaced with octonionic units. The quaternionic Dirac equation involves quaternionic units but it is essential that they are not represented as matrices. This allows the introduction of imaginary uni i commuting with the quaternionic and octonionic units and implies double of the degrees of freedom so that one can have analogs of complex spinors.<br/>
        The octonionic units are analogs of Pauli sigma matrices and the first problem is caused by the lacking anticommutativity of the real unit with other octonion units. The Dirac equation however makes sense also in this case.</li>
        <li>The 8-D masslessness condition must correspond to the condition that the real part of the square of Dirac operator on spinors vanishes. For momentum eigenstates this gives the usual algebraic conditions for masslessness.</li>
        <li>H spinors have a defined H-chirality guaranteeing separate conservation of quark and lepton numbers. H-chirality \(\epsilon\) is a product \(\epsilon=\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\) of \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities. Alls these chiralities should be definable also at the level of \(M^8\). Also the octonionic Dirac equation for H spinors should be consistent with the chirality condition.
            <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                <li>The decomposition of octonion units to quaternion units \(\{1,I_k|k=1,2,3\}\) and co-quaternion units \(I_4\{1,I_k|k=1,2,3\}\) suggests the identification of the counterpart of \(\Gamma_9\). The matrix \(\Gamma_9\) is defined as the product of H gamma matrices satisfies \(\Gamma_9^2=-1\), anticommutes with H gamma matrices. H chirality corresponds to the eigenvalue of \(i\Gamma_9\) equal to \(\epsilon=\pm 1\). The eigen spinors with chirality \(\epsilon\) are of the form \((1+\epsilon i\Gamma_9)\Psi_0\).<br/>
                The spinors with fixed H-chirality are tensor products of spinors of fixed \(M^4\) chirality and \(CP_2\) chirality and the product of these chiralities defines H-chirality.</li>
                <li>The operator \(iI_4\), satisfying \((iI_4)^2=1\), is a good guess for the counterpart of \(\Gamma_9\) for the octonionic spinors. The octospinors with a fixed \(M^8\) chirality \(\epsilon\) should be of the form \((1+\epsilon iI_4)\Psi_0\). It is easy to check that for an octospinor of form \(\Psi_\epsilon=\Psi_a+I_4\Psi_b\) having a fixed chirality \(\epsilon\), one obtains

    <p>
In this article the notion of fermion propagator is discussed. It is found that the construction is much more than a mere computational challenge. There are two alternative approaches. Fermionic propagation could correspond to a) a 4-D or lower-dimensional propagation at the space-time level for the induced spinor fields as analog of massless propagation or b) to 8-D propagation in \(H\) between points belonging to the space-time surface.
    </p>
    <p>
For the option b) the separate conservations of baryon and lepton number requires fixed \(H\)-chirality so that the spinor mode is sum of products of \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) spinors with fixed \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities whose product is +1 or -1. This implies that \(M^4\) propagation is massless. The Euclidean signature of \(CP_2\) in turn suggests that there is no propagation in \(CP_2\) and the \(CP_2\) projections \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) for the ends of the propagator line are the same. This allows a very simple form for the matrix elements of the propagator and the condition \(s_1=s_2\) implies that the propagation from \(s_1\) is possible to a discrete set of points \(s_2\). This has direct relevance for the understanding of color confinement and more or less implies the intuitively deduced TGD based model for elementary particles.
    </p>
    <p>
Although the option a) need not provide a realistic propagator, it could provide a very useful semiclassical picture. If the condition \(s_1=s_2\) is assumed, fermionic propagation along light-like geodesics of \(H\) is favored and in accordance with the model for elementary particles. This allows a classical space-time picture of particle massivation by p-adic thermodynamics and color confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
Also the interpretational and technical problems related to the construction of 4-D variants of super-conformal representations having spinor modes as ground states and to the p-adic thermodynamics are discussed.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">2. How does the propagation take place?</h2>
    <p>I have considered two alternative views concerning what fermion propagation could mean.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Fermions propagate along the 4-D space-time surface \(X^4\) as induced spinor fields and the propagator is defined by the analog of 4-D massless Dirac operator.</li>
        <li>Fermions propagate in H and virtuality in geometric sense could mean that they can leave the space-time surface during the propagation. Off mass-shell property would mean off-space-time surface.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Could the two interpretations for the fermion propagation be consistent? The space-time propagation as a 4-D propagation is geometrically much more restricted. Could the propagator code for the information about initial and final quantum states as a kind of quantum-classical correspondence?</p>

    <h3 id="leptons-quarks-quantized" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">2.1 Leptons and quarks as quantized free spinor fields in H</h3>
    <p>It is good to start with the description of H spinor fields and of the H Dirac equation. This topic is also discussed in Appendix A.</p>

        <li>The Dirac equation is satisfied by the spinor modes of H. They are massless in H but not in \(M^4\)(!). This is essential for the twistorization and the divergence-free nature of the theory.

        is the Dirac operator in \(CP_2\). Here \(D_k\) is covariant derivative, which is defined by the spinor connection of \(CP_2\) that encodes electroweak interactions. The Kähler gauge potential \(A_k\) for leptons is \(3A_k\) and for quarks \(A_k\). This explains the different electric charges of quarks and leptons.
        Twistorialization suggests that \(M^4\) allows the analog of Kähler structure whereas vielbein connection should be trivial by the flatness of the metric. Kähler form should satisfy the analog self-duality meaning that locally it is analogous to mutually orthogonal electric and magnetic fields of the same magnitude.</li>
        <li>Quarks correspond to triality t=1 partial waves and leptons to triality t=0 partial waves. These modes are not simply color triplets for physical quarks and color singlets for physical leptons. For physical fermions, a mechanism producing color triplets for quarks and singlets for leptons is needed.
        According to the first section of the Appendix, the color partial waves with different charges correspond to color partial waves characterized by an integer pair (p,q). p and q can thought of as giving the numbers of triplets and anti-triplets in the tensor containing the representation in question. The dimension of the color representation is \(d(p,q) = (1/2)(p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2)\).
        In the case of leptons, one has representations (p,p) for neutrinos and (3+p,p) for charged leptons. The dimensions are \((p+1)^2(p+2)\) for neutrinos and \((3+p+1)(p+1)(p+2)\) for charged leptons (Mistake in original formula, should be \((3+p+1)(p+1)(p+2)\) or similar based on (p,q) general formula, \(d(3+p,p) = 1/2 (p+4)(p+1)(2p+5)\) ). The color representations are the same for both \(CP_2\) chiralities which correspond to opposite \(M^4\) chiralities for a fixed H chirality.
        In the case of quarks one has representations (p+1,p) and (p+4,p) for D resp. U type quarks and the corresponding dimensions are \(1/2(p+2)(p+1)(2p+3)\) resp. \(1/2(p+5)(p+1)(2p+5)\). The two \(CP_2\) chiralities are transformed to each other by \(D(CP_2)\): covariantly right-handed neutrino is an exception since it is annihilated by \(D(CP_2)\).</li>
        <li>The charge assignable to color partial wave is not a local notion characterized by a spinor index since \(D(CP_2)\) mixes different isospin states, whose identification depends on the choice of the vierbein in \(CP_2\). This is understandable since the choice of the \(CP_2\) spinor basis is determined apart from a local U(2) rotation. The same problem is encountered in standard model and solved by going to unitary gauge. One can ask whether it might be possible to define the counterpart of the unitary gauge as a global choice of \(CP_2\) vierbein for which the \(CP_2\) spinor is constant or covariantly constant for a given color partial wave.</li>

        where the H-chiralities have changed because \(D(M^4)\) (\(D(CP_2)\) changes the chirality of \(M^4\) (\(CP_2\)). It can be said that both \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities are mixed when the mass is non-zero.</li>

    <h3 id="propagation-along-x4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">2.2 Does the propagation take place along space-time surface \(X^4\)?</h3>
    <p>For the modes of the induced spinor field the propagation would take place along the spacetime surface and possibly also along a related lower-dimensional surface such as a partonic 2-surface and light-like curves along it.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>This 4-dimensional (or possibly lower-dimensional) propagator corresponds to the inverse of the Dirac operator for the induced gamma matrices as projection of the 8-D vector formed by H gamma matrices. Induced gamma matrices anticommute to the induced metric.</li>
        <li>One can also consider modified gamma matrices determined as contractions of the canonical momentum currents of the classical action with the gamma matrices of H <a href="#ref-allb-cspin">[cspin, wcwnew (allb)]</a>. These do not anticommute to the induced metric but for them 4-D super-conformal symmetry would be exact and classical field equations would appear as a consistency condition guaranteeing hermiticity.
        For the induced gamma matrices super-conformal symmetry is violated at the vertices <a href="#ref-btart-whatgravitons">[whatgravitons (btart)]</a>, where the full action makes itself visible: outside the singularities minimal surface property consistent with volume action, giving rise to induced gamma matrices, holds true.</li>
        <li>The beauty of this view (also that based on H propagator) is that the constructions of the propagator and of the physical states are completely separated from each other. The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator for induced spinors. For H propagator the construction is easy but the situation need not be the same now.</li>
        <li>One might hope that holography=holomorphy principle <a href="#ref-btart-Frenkel">[Frenkel, Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> allows the explicit construction of the propagator using complex coordinates assignable to the Hamilton-Jacobi structure involving hypercomplex coordinates (u,v) and complex coordinates (w,\(\bar{w}\)) <a href="#ref-btart-HJ">[HJ (btart)]</a>. Hypercomplex coordinates (u,v) would be the analogs of light-like coordinates and the Minkowskian signature would make the propagation possible.
        In the Euclidean situation the propagator would be bilinear in holomorphic and antiholomorphic modes \(h_1=h_2\) would be a delta function singularity. Now the situation is more complex but one might hope that Wick rotation for the second complex coordinate, transforming it to hypercomplex coordinate, could give the propagator.
        For light-like curves at partonic orbits identified as fermionic lines, the propagator can be constructed explicitly by a semiclassical argument.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One can criticize this approach.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In the case of Minkowski space it is clear what virtuality of the fermion means for the massless case: the explicit expression for the massless fermion propagator implies the massive virtual modes. For virtual modes with \(p^2 \neq 0\) \(p^k\gamma_k\Psi\) is nonvanishing.</li>
        <li>What could the non-vanishing virtual momentum squared correspond to in the recent case? The condition \(D\Psi = (\Gamma^k D_k + \Gamma^{\bar{k}} D_{\bar{k}})\Psi = 0\), reduces for the holomorphic modes, satisfying \(D_{\bar{k}}\Psi=0\), to the condition \(\Gamma^k\Psi=0\). An analogous condition is true for the antiholomorphic modes.
        \(\Gamma^k\Psi \neq 0\) should be true for the virtual modes. This condition is consistent with the condition that H chirality is fixed but means mixing of the \(M^4\) chiralities which is the signature of massivation due to the virtual mass.</li>

    <h4 id="deduction-h-propagator" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.3.2 Deduction of the H propagator</h4>
    <p>The separate conservation of lepton and quark numbers forces the counterpart of the massless propagator, not only in H but also in \(M^4\).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The H propagator corresponds to the inverse of the massless Dirac operator of H. It is essential that the modes have a well-defined H-chirality meaning that lepton and quarks numbers are separately conserved.</li>
        <li>One could argue that since \(M^4\) masses for spinor modes are given by \(p^2=\Lambda_n^2\), where \(\Lambda_n^2\) is the eigenvalue of \(D(CP_2)^2\), each mode gives rise to a propagator with mass \(\Lambda_n^2\). Since \(\Lambda_n\) corresponds to \(CP_2\) mass scale, only the covariantly constant right-handed neutrino would propagate above \(CP_2\) mass scale! The other modes would propagate only in the \(CP_2\) length scale. Note however that in \(M^4\) massive propagation along light-like geodesics reduces to massless propagation.
        The second problem is that for this view the poles at \(p^2=\Lambda_n^2\) do not emerge and must be put in by hand as normalization factors for off-mass-shell states. The reason is that the \(1/D^2\) factor disappears in the matrix elements of \(D/(D^2+i\epsilon)\) between the massive H spinor modes \(\Psi\), which are of form \(\Psi=D\Phi\). The only exception is the right-handed neutrino, which is covariantly constant in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. Only the right-handed neutrino would propagate.
        The delicate difference with respect to the ordinary massive propagation in \(M^4\) is that the ordinary massive propagator is given by \(D_F=1/(p^k\gamma_k+m) = (p^k\gamma_k-m)/(p^2-m^2+i\epsilon)\) by \(p^2-m^2=(p^k\gamma_k+m)(p^k\gamma_k-m)\). In TGD, a propagator massive in \(M^4\) sense is massless in the 8-D sense and one has \(D_F=1/D = D/(D^2+i\epsilon)\).</li>
        <li>What does the fixing the H-chirality implied by the separate conservation of quark and lepton numbers mean? The H-spinor is a combination of two spinors, where the \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities \(\epsilon_1\) and \(\epsilon_2\) are well defined and their product \(\epsilon=\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\) is +1 or -1 depending on whether it is a quark or a lepton. The combinations (1,-1) and (-1,1) and on the other hand (1,1) and (-1,-1) are possible.
        But the fixed \(M^4\) chirality means that propagation is like that for a massless fermion in \(M^4\)! The mass spectrum for \(D(P_2)\) does not show itself in the \(M^4\) part of the propagator and the construction of states and of the propagator are completely separate problems. This picture also corresponds to the picture of QCD where massless quarks are assumed as an approximation.</li>
        <li>What about the propagation in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom? It follows directly from the defining condition that the propagator is a delta function in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. There is no propagation at all. This just what the Euclidian signature of \(CP_2\) suggests. The matrix elements of the propagator between quantum states constructed from the conformal representations having H spinor modes as ground states are extremely simple and reduce to the same form as in QFTs for fermions with internal quantum numbers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="h-propagator-consequences" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.3.3 Some consequences</h4>
    <p>This result has some highly non-trivial consequences.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The H propagation includes the constraint that the end points of the propagator belong to the space-time surface through the fact that \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) are on the same spacetime surface. Since there is no propagation at all in \(CP_2\) the points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are identical!
        The condition \(s_1=s_2\) at the spacetime surface gives two complex conditions for \(s_2\) when \(s_1\) is fixed and the result is a discrete set of points on the spacetime surface! Only in these cases does propagation occur. The theory discretizes itself in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom! Discretization would not be an approximation but a prediction of the theory. This is the basic idea behind the identification of cognitive representation as a number theoretic discretization using points of the embedding space for which H coordinates make sense both as real numbers and numbers in an extension of p-adic numbers.</li>
        <li>The light-like parton orbits are in a special role now since the partonic 2-surfaces at the ends of the parton orbit can have a large number of common points if their \(CP_2\) projections are identical. This would explain why they are physically in exceptional position.
        The picture of propagation along light-like geodesics suggest by physical intuition is consistent with the condition \(s_1=s_2\) but a light-like geodesic is not needed for the H-propagator.</li>
        <li>From this it should be easy to understand what happens in quark and color confinement (gluons are bound states of quarks and antiquarks in TGD). The classical time evolution involves the failure of classical determinism identifiable as p-adic non-determinism <a href="#ref-btart-Langlands2025">[Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a>. There is a sequence of analogs of multifurcations involving non-determinism. In this sequence the number of common points possessed by the initial and final partonic orbits decreases and eventually the propagator amplitude becomes very small. This means color confinement.</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">3. A model for 4-D propagation as a propagation along light-like geodesics of H</h2>
    <p>The previous considerations favor H propagation with the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) implying that no propagation takes place in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This means that the propagation takes place along \(M^4\) geodesics.</p>
    <p>The 4-D propagation along \(X^4\) involves induced spinor structure and my intuitive feeling is that also this perspective is important, at least as semiclassical model. The condition \(s_1 = s_2\) for H propagation suggests that fermion propagation is always 1-dimensional and along a light-like geodesic of H. This would give a very concrete classical view of the propagation even if a 4-D propagator were not useful. In particular, the p-adic thermal massivation could be modelled semi-classically.</p>

    <h3 id="identify-4d-propagator-lightlike-geodesics" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.1 Can one identify the 4-D propagator as a propagator along light-like geodesics of H?</h3>
    <p>The 4-D variant of the propagator could be identified as a propagator along light-like geodesics of H. This idea has been already mentioned.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The light-like geodesics of H are of form \((m(t), s(t))\), where \(m(t)\) is a light-like geodesic of \(M^4\) and \(s(t)\) is a geodesic of \(CP_2\). For \(s(t)\) there are two options. It is either a geodesic circle or a point.</li>
        <li>The condition \(s_1 = s_2\) for H-propagator means that \(s(t)\) must be a point of \(CP_2\). Hence the propagation takes place along light-like geodesics of \(M^4\) for a fixed point of \(CP_2\). This is not quite the original idea.</li>
        <li>The original idea was that the propagation takes place along light-like geodesics of \(X^4 \subset H\). This means that \((m(t), s(t))\) belongs to \(X^4\). This implies constraints. For instance, for cosmic strings \(X^2 \times Y^2 \subset M^4 \times CP_2\), \(s(t)\) must belong to \(Y^2\), which is a complex submanifold of \(CP_2\). If \(Y^2\) is a geodesic sphere \(S^2_I\) or \(S^{II}\), then \(s(t)\) can be any geodesic of \(Y^2\). If \(Y^2\) is a point, this case reduces to the previous one.</li>
        <li>The intuitive picture is that the lines of generalized Feynman diagrams are light-like geodesics of H. This means that the points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are points of \(CP_2\) rather than general points of H. This is achieved if the H-propagator is proportional to \(\delta^4(s_1 − s_2)\) as the Euclidean signature of \(CP_2\) metric suggests.</li>
    </ol>

        <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
    </div>
    <p>Here \(\gamma^k\) are H gamma matrices. \(\delta(s_1, s_2)\) is delta function in \(CP_2\). This propagator is for a fixed H-chirality.</p>
    <p>The integration of \(S_F (h_1, h_2)\) over \(h_2\) gives \(\gamma^k(\partial_k\delta^4(m_1 − m_2))\) so that the propagator is indeed the \(M^4\) part of the H propagator.</p>

    <h3 id="how-padic-mass-scale-emerges" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.3 How does the p-adic mass scale emerge?</h3>
    <p>The p-adic mass scale emerges from p-adic thermodynamics for the representations of superconformal algebras. This means that the states are thermal mixtures of states with different masses. This is a quantum statistical description and the question is what is the geometric meaning of the p-adic mass.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The H-propagator is massless. How can it give rise to massive propagation effectively? In the description of particle reactions, one sums over intermediate states which are on mass shell states with p-adic thermal mass. This is a possible answer.</li>
        <li>At the semi-classical level the light-like geodesics of \(M^4\) are replaced with time-like geodesics in \(M^4\) for a particle with p-adic thermal mass. For instance, in the case of cosmic string \(X^2 \times Y^2\), the string \(X^2\) is a time-like geodesic surface (string world sheet). The projection of the light-like geodesic of H to \(M^4\) is a time-like geodesic. This is like the description of massive particle in terms of 5-D light-like geodesic in Kaluza-Klein theories.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The p-adic length scale hypothesis states that the p-adic primes p associated with elementary particles are near powers of 2: \(p \approx 2^k\), k prime. For instance, for electron k = 127. This is one of the key predictions of TGD.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">3. A model for 4-D propagation as propagation along lightlike geodesics of \(H\)</h2>
    <p>Quantum classical correspondence suggests that the 4-D Dirac equation for the induced spinor fields at the space-time surface has a physical meaning. The condition that no propagation in \(CP_2\) occurs in H propagator suggests that the fermionic propagation in \(X^4\) reduces to 1-D propagation along light-like geodesics of H and it is interesting to look for the consequences of this assumption.</p>

    <h3 id="fermion-propagation-lightlike-geodesic-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.1 Does the notion of fermion propagation along a light-like geodesic line of H make sense?</h3>
    <p>The fermionic propagation in H looks like a realistic option and massless H- propagation could be interpreted in terms of ”off-space-time sheet” propagation as analogs of off-mass-shell propagation. On the other hand, the induction of spinor connection <a href="#ref-K9">[K9]</a>, <a href="#ref-K7">[K7]</a>, <a href="#ref-L9">[L9]</a> makes \(CP_2\) spinor fields dynamical and the induction of spinor fields can be seen as its natural fermionic counterpart. Could the solutions of the induced or modified Dirac equation as geometric analogs of on-mass shell states have a physical meaning? What makes them so attractive is the 4-D conformal invariance allowing us to construct them explicitly. Their analogs also appear in string models.</p>
    <p>There is an entire dimensional hierarchy involved: besides 4-D propagation also propagation in dimensions D = 1, 2, 3 are possible and these modes have edge states (see this) as condensed matter analogs <a href="#ref-L5">[L5]</a>. As the matrix elements for the propagation of color fermion states are expected to be very small except for fermionic lines at intersections of string world sheets and light-like partonic 2-surfaces. In the 1-D case the construction of the analog of the propagator is simple. Although the propagator might not be a useful object, the classical view about space-time propagation could be very useful and justified by quantum classical correspondence.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>1-D H propagation between \(h_1 = (m_1, s_1)\) and \(h_2 = (m_2, s_2)\) is expected to be possible only when the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) is true. The set of points \(s_2\) satisfying this condition for a given \(s_1\) is discrete. In ZEO, the H propagator defines a map between the 3-surfaces at the boundaries of CD. This suggests that 1-D propagation in \(X^4\) is preferred. At partonic 2-surfaces with 2-D \(CP_2\) projection, which does not change during the time evolution each points \(s_1\) has at least one \(s_2\). One can consider also lattice-like structures.</li>
        <li>8-D light-likeness and restriction to a fermion line suggests that this propagation is along a light-like curve of H belonging to the space-time surface. If this light-like curve is geodesic, then for for \(s_1 \neq s_2\) it is a light-like geodesic associated with \(M^4 \times S^1\), where \(S^1\) is the unique geodesic circle connecting \(s_1 \neq s_2\). For \(s_1 = s_2\) all geodesics belonging to the space-time surface are possible and even a 4-D set of geodesic circles of \(CP_2\) is possible unless one poses additional conditions. For instance, 2-D \(CP_2\) projection is such a constraint. In this kind of situation, one might speak of a resonance-like phenomenon.<br>
        Could one consider additional conditions? Light-like geodesics as basic geometric aspect of twistors has also a \(CP_2\) counterpart. For the \(CP_2\) counterpart for twistorialization <a href="#ref-L17">[L17]</a>, the geodesic lines connecting a given point to infinity of the local Eguchi-Hanson coordinates <a href="#ref-L9">[L9]</a> defining a homologically non-trivial geodesic sphere is in a special role and would correspond to the twistor sphere of the \(CP_2\) twistor space \(T(CP_2) = SU(3)/U(1) \times U(1)\). Could the limitation to this set of \(CP_2\) circles make sense? The fact that two \(CP_2\) geodesic circles always have an intersection point has a counterpart for \(M^4\) twistors: the spheres of twistor bundles for two points connected by a light-like geodesic intersect.</li>
        <li>One cannot exclude the alternative in which the propagation occurs along general light-like geodesics of \(X^4\). Also in this case the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) implies that the set of points \(s_2\) connected to point \(s_1\) is finite. This option will not be discussed in the sequel. Also in this case the resonance can take place when the \(CP_2\) projection is a geodesic sphere.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These observations provide motivations for the study of the 1-D fermionic propagation for induced spinor fields.</p>

    <p>It is interesting to study in more detail the assumption that the motion is along a light-like geodesic of \(M^4 \times S^1\).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The light-like geodesic of H makes it possible to get from the point \(s_1\) in \(CP_2\) to point satisfying in general \(s_2 \neq s_1\). In this case the velocity in \(M^4\) is less than the speed of light: \(\beta = v/c < 1\) and the \(M^4\) mass is not effectively zero as it is for a light-like geodesics of \(M^4\). It is also possible that the \(CP_2\) projection of the particle orbit wraps n times around \(S^1\) and returns to the original point in \(CP_2\). This would indeed happen if the propagator in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom reduces to a delta function. At least this assumption is a very promising simplification since the length scale of \(CP_2\) is very small compared to the length of the projection of the geodesic line in \(M^4\).</li>
        <li>The fermion can be thought of as moving along the light-like geodesic of \(M^4 \times S^1\):
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Light-like geodesic motion" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} (m_0 = t, m_3 \equiv z = \beta t), \Phi = \omega t, \beta = \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - R^2\omega^2} \le 1. \end{equation}">
            <p class="equation">$$ \begin{equation} (m_0 = t, m_3 \equiv z = \beta t), \Phi = \omega t, \beta = \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - R^2\omega^2} \le 1. \end{equation} $$</p>
            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        Here \(\beta\) is the particle’s velocity in \(M^4\). The projection of the particle orbit in \(CP_2\) is a geodesic circle. The starting point and end point of the propagator are on this geodesic line.</li>
        <li>Since the fermion is no longer moving along the light-like geodesic line of \(M^4\), it no longer behaves like a massless particle in \(M^4\) sense. Quantum classical correspondence suggests that this serves as a classical correlate for the mass of the particle resulting from p-adic thermodynamics. Unless \(\beta\) is very close to 1, i.e. unless the parameter \(\omega R\) is very small, there will be an exponential damping caused by the thermal mass. If p-dic thermodynamics described the situation, a reasonable guess is that the parameter \(\omega R\) is of the order of p-adic thermal mass using \(CP_2\) mass as a unit (here \(\hbar = 1\)) <a href="#ref-L6">[L6]</a>.</li>
        <li>If the \(CP_2\) propagator is approximated as or is a delta function then \(s_1 = s_2\) can be realized if the particle wraps n times around \(S^1\):
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Wrapping condition for CP2 propagator" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} \Delta\Phi = n \times 2\pi. \end{equation}">
            <p class="equation">$$ \begin{equation} \Delta\Phi = n \times 2\pi. \end{equation} $$</p>
            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        In this case a 4-D set of circles \(S^1\) belonging to \(X^4\) is possible and one can say that a resonance occurs. For \(CP_2\) type extremals this could occur. This is also the case if the \(CP_2\) projections is a geodesic sphere. The twistorial picture would suggest that the set of circles correspond to a homologically trivial geodesic sphere of \(CP_2\) as an analog of the twistor sphere parametrizing light-like geodesics in \(M^4\).</li>
        <li>For \(M^4\) the time coordinate difference in the \(M^4\) propagator would be
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Time and space coordinate difference in M4" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} t_2 - t_1 = \frac{n2\pi}{\omega}, \quad z_2 - z_1 = \beta(t_2 - t_1) = \beta \frac{n2\pi}{\omega}. \end{equation}">
            <p class="equation">$$ \begin{equation} t_2 - t_1 = \frac{n2\pi}{\omega}, \quad z_2 - z_1 = \beta(t_2 - t_1) = \beta \frac{n2\pi}{\omega}. \end{equation} $$</p>
            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        This could actually be a good approximation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Suppose that the model indeed provides a semiclassical geometric description for the p-adic thermal massivation.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>One has \(m_2 - m_1 = (t, \beta t)\). The difference \(a^2 = (m_2 - m_1)^2\) is the square of the Lorentz invariant distance of \(M^4\) and the parameter \(a\) should be of the order of the hadronic length scale \(L_H\). This gives
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Lorentz invariant distance in M4" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} \frac{a}{R} = \sqrt{(m_2 - m_1)^2} = n2\pi\beta. \end{equation}">

        </div>
        R is the \(CP_2\) radius and the natural length unit. The result is amazingly simple. \(a/R \sim L_H/R\) could be interpreted as the ratio of the hadron sizes scale to \(CP_2\) radius. This gives estimate for n:
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Estimate for n" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} n = \frac{L_H}{2\pi\beta R} \approx \frac{L_H}{2\pi R} \sim 10^{15}. \end{equation}">

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        which gives \(R/L_H \approx 1/(2\pi n)\). The parameter \(\omega R = \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}\) is very small: one has
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Approximation for 1-beta" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} 1 - \beta \approx 1 - \frac{R^2\omega^2}{2}. \end{equation}">

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div></li>
        <li>One can estimate the order of magnitude for \(\omega\) and therefore also for \(1 - \beta\). By quantum classical correspondence, \(\omega\) should be of the order of the p-adic mass scale \(m_q\) of quark: \(\omega \approx m_q\). This gives
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Estimate for 1-beta with quark mass" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} 1 - \beta \approx 1 - \frac{R^2m_q^2}{2}. \end{equation}">

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        For \(\beta\) this gives and order of magnitude estimate relating \(\beta\) and n to each other:

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        The order of magnitude is \(10^{-32}\) for \(m_H/m_q = 1\). The p-adic probabilities for the lowest excitations appearing in p-adic thermodynamics are extremely small and of this order of magnitude. This guarantees that the p-adic thermal mass coming from excitations with \(CP_2\) mass scale is of order particle mass. p-Adic length scale hypothesis \(p \approx 2^k\) gives \(m_qR \sim R/L_p \sim 1/\sqrt{p} = 2^{-k/2}\). Therefore one has
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="omega R relation to p-adic length scale" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} \omega R \approx m_qR = \frac{R}{L_p} \sim 2^{-k/2}. \end{equation}">

        All these estimates are rough order of magnitude estimates.</li>
        <li>The expressions for the initial and final points of the light-like geodesic must be placed to the space-time representation of the \(M^4\) propagator for which a concrete formula must be given as a Fourier transform. The \(CP_2\) points are in complex coordinates \(s_2 = (R\sin(\omega Rt), 0, 0, 0)\) and \(s_1 = (0, 0, 0, 0)\). For \(s_1 = s_2\) this gives

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        The relevant parameter would be n, which would be very large and determined by the p-adic length-scale hypothesis.</li>

    <h3 id="propagator-induced-spinor-fields-geodesic-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.3 Could the propagator for the induced spinor fields along a light-like geodesic of H make sense?</h3>
    <p>It is not at all clear whether the propagator in \(X^4\) or along light-like geodesics of H is a useful concept. It is however interesting to see whether one could define and calculate the propagator for the Dirac operator associated with the induced spinor fields. There is dimensional hierarchy: 4-D propagator, 2-D propagator at string world sheets, and 1-D propagator at fermion lines. Perhaps also 3-D propagator at partonic orbits. Holography= holomorphy vision could make it possible to solve the propagator in terms of holomorphic solutions of the modified Dirac equation.</p>
    <p>The 1-D situation suggested by the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) is especially simple since the light-like geodesics of H defining fermion lines are very simple. Could this be possible in this case?</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The induced gamma matrix \(\Gamma_t\) is defined as a projection of the 8-vector defined by H gamma matrices to the light-like geodesic \((m_0 = t, m_3 = \beta t, \Phi = \omega t)\):
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Induced gamma matrix Gamma_t" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} \Gamma_t = \gamma_0 + \beta\gamma_z + \omega R\gamma_\phi, \quad \gamma^2_\phi = -1. \end{equation}">

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div></li>
        <li>One could identify the fermionic lines as light-like \(M^4 \times S^1\) geodesics. The modified Dirac equation \(\Gamma_t D_t\Psi = 0\) is proportional to \(1/g_{tt}\), which diverges. This suggests that \(D_t\Psi = 0\) or \(\Gamma_t\Psi = 0\) as a counterpart of the Dirac equation or both of them are true for fermionic on-mass-shell states. The condition \(\Gamma_t\Psi = 0\) as the analog of \(\gamma^k p_k\Psi = 0\) would fix a definite H chirality correlating \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities and should hold true also for off-mass-shell states. The off-mass shell property would correspond to \(D_t\Psi = p\Psi\), where p is the counterpart of mass squared for off-mass-shell mass.</li>
        <li>The analog of the momentum space propagator associated with a point pair connected by a light-like H geodesic would be
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Momentum space propagator D_F" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} D_F = \frac{p\Gamma_t}{p^2+i\epsilon}. \end{equation}">

            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        Here p is the analog of momentum. \(D_F\) would be contracted by H spinor mode at both ends of the light-like H geodesic connecting the points of H. These modes would be on-massshell-modes as solutions of the Dirac equation of H, just like the end points of the Feynman graphs. The spectrum of the Dirac operator of H would not appear at all in the propagator, which would mean an enormous simplification. This picture is also consistent with the view based on the conformal algebra.</li>
        <li>The spatial representation of the propagator would be given by a Fourier transform as
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Spatial representation of D_F" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} D_F (t_1, t_2) = \frac{\Gamma_t}{2\pi} \int dp \frac{\exp(ip(t_1-t_2)/\omega)}{p+i\epsilon}. \end{equation}">

        The ends of the propagator lines satisfy \(t_1 - t_2 = t = n\omega R\). For momenta \(p = k\omega/n, k \in \mathbb{Z}\), the phase factors would be equal to 1 and a constructive interference would take place. One can argue that the sum over these momenta gives the dominating contribution to the propagator. One can also argue that only these momenta are allowed by the boundary conditions at the ends of the propagator line. This contribution would be

One can fix the \(M^4\) points \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) apart from the constraint \((t \approx n\omega2\pi R, z = \beta t)\) but must integrate over \(CP_2\) points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\).</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this article the identification and calculation of the fermion propagator \(S_F(h_1,h_2)\) in \(H=M^4 \times CP_2\) is discussed in detail. Also the definition of fermion propagator at space-time surface is considered.</p>

    <h3 id="basic-questions" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">1.1 Basic questions</h3>
    <p>Let us summarize the basic physical picture first. The following picture is only one of the many variants and must of course be taken with reservations.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The TGD view of fundamental interactions <a href="#ref-btart-TGD2024I">[TGD2024I, TGD2024II (btart)]</a> differs from that of the standard model. The notion of color differs from that of QCD and electroweak gauge potentials correspond to the components of the induced spinor connection of \(CP_2\) <a href="#ref-allb-tgdnewphys">[tgdnewphys1, tgdnewphys2 (allb)]</a>. A strong correlation between mass, color quantum numbers and electroweak quantum numbers at the fundamental level corresponding to space-time surfaces is predicted <a href="#ref-btart-isospinbreak">[isospinbreak (btart)]</a>. The standard view emerges as an approximation at the QFT limit.</li>
        <li>In \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom, well-defined H chirality implies that the H propagator \(D_F((m_1,s_1),(m_2,s_2))\) is reduced to a bilocal inner product for the two modes with the same \(CP_2\) chirality defined by the propagator factor associated with the propagator. An important constraint is that the end points are restricted to the space-time surface. If the propagator reduces to the delta function in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom, as the Euclidean metric suggests, one has \(s_1=s_2\) with very powerful consequences. Second important point is that in \(M^4\) the propagation is between identical \(M^4\) chiralities by the separate conservation of lepton and quark quantum numbers.</li>
        <li>What does one mean with a virtual fermion now? Propagation in H is the natural geometric definition for virtuality. The first naive guess was that the virtual fermions correspond to masses \(p^2=\Lambda_n^2\), \(\Lambda_n^2\) is the eigenvalue of the \(CP_2\) Dirac operator, as predicted by the H Dirac equation in H.
        This however leads to a conclusion that the propagator does not have these masses as poles unless the normalization of the mass shell states is such that poles are there. Furthermore, these masses do not correspond to the masses of physical fermion, which are generated by p-adic thermodynamics. This picture looks therefore unphysical.</li>
        <li>The condition that quark and lepton numbers are separately conserved forces us to assume a fixed H-chirality so that fermions are massless in 8-D sense. This implies that the spinor modes are superpositions of modes for which \(M^4\) chirality and \(CP_2\) chirality are well-defined and either the same or opposite depending on whether quark or lepton is in question. Fixed \(M^4\) chirality requires a massless propagation in \(M^4\). This is a rather dramatic prediction and means that propagation completely separates from the properties and construction of states.
        \(CP_2\) has Euclidean signature of metric, which suggests that propagation is not possible at all. The propagator would reduce to a delta function in \(CP_2\): the end points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) would be identical for \(CP_2\) propagation. A second dramatic prediction is that, the condition \(s_1=s_2\) allows for a fixed point \(s_1\) only a discrete set of final points.</li>
        <li>The propagation in H is analog of off-mass shell propagation as off-space-time surface propagation. The notion of induced spinor structure however suggests that it might make sense to speak of propagation along the space-time surface as analog of on-mass-shell propagation.
        The induced Dirac equation in \(X^4\) is analogous to the massless Dirac equation. The condition \(s_1=s_2\) however suggests that this propagation is along light-like geodesics of H, whose projection is a geodesic circle of \(CP_2\). This would give a classical geometric correlate for the fermion propagation even if the space-time propagator might not be needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="how-physical-color" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.1 How do the physical color quantum numbers emerge?</h4>
    <p>It must be taken into account that physical fermions are either color singlets or triplets, not arbitrarily high color partial waves satisfying only the triality condition t=1 for quarks and t=0 for leptons.</p>
    <p>This is achieved in two ways.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Neutrino-antineutrino \(\nu_L\bar{\nu}_R\) pair screens the electroweak charges above weak boson Compton length and could also screen the anomalous parts of color charges.</li>
        <li>The solutions Dirac equation are ground states of conformal representations in which the action of a conformal scaling generator generates higher excitations, which can have color quantum numbers which add to those of color partial waves to give rise to color singlets and triplets.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>p-Adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> describes the thermodynamics of the scaling generator, and gives excellent predictions for the particle masses so that conformal algebra is involved in any case.</p>
    <p>For the proposed form of the H propagator, the construction of the quantum states separates completely from that for the propagator.</p>

    <h4 id="confinement-scale" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.2 How could the confinement scale emerge?</h4>
    <p>In QCD, confinement occurring on some \(M^4\) scale, the confinement scale, is a fundamental concept. Free quarks are the basic dynamical entities below the confinement scale and transform to hadrons above this scale.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In attempts to understand this, the space-time representation of H propagator \(D_F((m_1,s_1),(m_2,s_2))\) for the massa propagator \(M^4\) degrees of freedom should be used (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Propagator</a>).
        One can consider two options depending on whether the propagation occurs in H or in \(X^4\). What is expected to happen in the case of H propagation, is the following.
            <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                <li>At least in short scales when \(a^2=(m_1-m_2)^2\) (a is Minkowski distance is small enough, the propagator is essentially a delta function \(\delta(s_1,s_2)\) in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This would be a phase where the quarks are free and effectively massless. What is remarkable is that the \(s_1=s_2\) condition implies that for a given \(s_1\) there is only a discrete set of points that the propagator can connect! At partonic orbits for which \(CP_2\) projection is fixed the number of these points would be large.</li>
                <li>If the condition \(s_1=s_2\) holds true quite generally, the classical non-determinism of the space-time dynamics implies that the number of points satisfying these conditions is reduced during the time evolution and makes propagation impossible for large values of \(a^2\). This would mean quark confinement. This of course also applies to possible colored excitations of leptons predicted by TGD and for which there is some evidence <a href="#ref-allb-leptc">[leptc (allb)]</a>.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It is reasonable to expect that the p-adic length scale determines the scale at which the confinement occurs. This is where the algebraic geometry of the spacetime surface comes into play.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here holography=holomorphy vision suggests a concrete approach.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In the holography=holomorphy vision <a href="#ref-btart-Frenkel">[Frenkel, Langlands2025 (btart)]</a>, space-time surfaces corresponds to the roots of polynomial pair \(f=(f_1,f_2): H \rightarrow C^2\) of generalized complex coordinates of H (one hypercomplex coordinate and 3 complex coordinates). They allow as dynamic symmetries the maps \(g=(g_1,g_2): C^2 \rightarrow C^2\) defined as functional compositions \(f \rightarrow g \circ f\).
        One can define prime polynomial pairs f as those which do not allow a decomposition \(f=g \circ h\). The prime polynomial pairs \(g=(g_1,g_2)\) can be defined similarly. The pairs \((g_1,Id)\) are of special interest and in this case the prime polynomials \(g_1(p)\) have prime degree p.</li>
        <li>One should study the H propagator \(D_F((m_1,s_1),(m_2,s_2))\) for the polynomials \(g_p\) and the functional iterates \(g_p^{\circ k} \circ f\). The integration over \(CP_2\) projections of the end points gives a bilocal inner product of the modes. The constraint \(s_1=s_2\) reduces it to an ordinary inner product for the \(CP_2\) spinor modes.
        The number of point pairs satisfying the constraint \(s_1=s_2\) depends on the space-time surface. The functional iterates of \(g_p\) involve classical non-determinism identifiable as p-adic non-determinism <a href="#ref-btart-HHtwistor">[HHtwistor (btart)]</a> so that the number space-time points satisfying the constraint \(s_1=s_2\) decreases as the number k of iteration steps increases. This would make propagation over too long scales impossible. p-Adic length scale could correspond to this scale. Note that very large primes p are involved: for the electron one has \(p=M_{127}=2^{127}-1\).
        The confinement scale can be identified as a p-adic length scale for quarks or hadrons, which is determined by the thermal mass predicted by p-adic thermodynamics. The larger the value of p, the longer the confinement scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Concerning the option based on \(X^4\) propagation two observations can be made.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The possibly existing \(X^4\) propagator would be the analog of a massless propagator since the Dirac equation for induced spinor fields in \(X^4\) is a generalization of the massless Dirac equation. This notion makes sense also for the lower dimensional surfaces of \(X^4\) and 1-D light-like curves are natural candidates for fermion lines.</li>
        <li>An observation of possible relevance is that the masses of quarks are effectively zero for the propagation along the light-like \(M^4\) geodesics along parton surfaces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="effective-mass-scale" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.3 How the effective mass scale of a fermion is determined?</h4>
    <p>There are two basic questions to be answered. Is the p-adic mass scale determined by the spectrum of \(CP_2\) masses or by p-adic thermodynamics? Does the spectrum of \(CP_2\) masses or p-adic thermal masses appear at the level of propagator or only at the level of initial and final states of propagation?</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>A naive assumption would be that the quark and lepton masses appear in the propagator depend on the spectrum of color excitations \(m^2=\lambda_n^2\) for the fermions involved (\(\nu_L\bar{\nu}_R\) for the second option). Several arguments suggest this cannot be the case.
        p-Adic thermodynamics, in which the basic parameters characterizing the particle are the p-adic prime p and the p-adic temperature \(T_p=1/n\), works excellently so that it seems that \(CP_2\) mass spectrum does not make itself visible in the propagator. In p-adic thermodynamics, a large \(p \approx 2^k\), simplifies enormously and something similar can be expected now as well.</li>
        <li>If the propagation takes in H, it is massless for a fixed H chirality so that the eigenvalue spectrum of \(D(CP_2)\) is not visible in propagation. This separation between the structure of states and propagator would be a huge simplification.</li>
        <li>Concerning \(X^4\) propagation, the semiclassical description as light-like H geodesics of the geodesic manifold \(M^4 \times S^1 \subset M^4 \times CP_2\) could be considered as a model. The masslessness of H would no longer imply masslessness in \(M^4\). One could say that p-adic thermal excitations deform the light-like geodesics of \(M^4\) to those of \(M^4 \times S^1 \subset H\). Also this suggests that the masses are not visible in the \(X^4\) propagator as also the fact that they do not appear in the \(X^4\) Dirac operator suggests.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="plan-of-article" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">1.2 Plan of the article</h3>
    <p>The plan of the article is as follows.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>I have considered several approaches to the calculation of the fermion propagator and in the following I describe the most elegant looking view about the fermion propagation as propagation in H. Assuming a fixed H chirality, the propagator reduces to massless propagator in H and is proportional to delta function in \(CP_2\) so that no propagation occurs in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This has powerful consequences and the existing intuitive picture about fundamental fermion lines as light-like geodesics at partonic 2-surfaces follows. One can also understand color confinement in this picture.</li>
        <li>The 4-D propagation along \(X^4\) involves induced spinor structure and my intuitive feeling is that also this perspective is important, at least as semiclassical model. The condition \(s_1=s_2\) for H propagation suggests that fermion propagation is always 1-dimensional and along a light-like geodesic of H. This would give a very concrete classical view of the propagation even if a 4-D propagator were not useful. In particular, the p-adic thermal massivation could be modelled semi-classically.</li>
        <li>Also the problems related to the origin of p-adicity and interpretational problems of p-adic thermodynamics and to the generalized conformal invariance will be discussed in the Appendix.</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">Appendix A: About the solutions of Dirac equation in H</h2>
    <p>This section serves as an Appendix and re-represents information appearing in <a href="#ref-allb-mless">[mless (allb)]</a>. First the TGD view of electroweak and color interactions is compared with the standard view. After that the general solutions of the Dirac equation in H are discussed.</p>

    <h3 id="tgd-vs-standard-model" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">A.1 How does the TGD view of standard model interactions differ from the standard model view?</h3>
    <p>TGD based vision standard model interactions differs in several respects from the standard view.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>In TGD, elementary particles correspond to closed monopole flux tubes as analogs of hadronic strings connecting two Minkowskian space-time sheets by Euclidean wormhole contacts. The light-like orbits of wormhole throats (partonic orbits) carry fermions and antifermions at light curves located at light-like 3-surfaces, which define interfaces between Minkowskian string world regions and Euclidean regions identified as deformed \(CP_2\) type extremals.</li>
        <li>The basic difference at the level of H spinor fields is that color quantum numbers are not spin-like but are replaced with color partial waves in \(CP_2\). Color degrees of freedom are analogous to the rotational degrees of freedom of a rigid body. An infinite number of color partial waves emerges for both quarks and leptons. In TGD, color and electroweak degrees of freedom are strongly correlated as is also clear from the fact that color symmetries correspond to the non-broken symmetries as isometries of \(CP_2\) and electroweak symmetries correspond to the holonomies of \(CP_2\), which are automatically broken gauge symmetries.<br>
        The spectrum of color partial waves in H is different for U and D type quarks and for charged leptons and neutrinos. The triality of the partial wave is zero for leptons and 1 resp. -1 for quarks resp. antiquarks. At the level of fundamental fermions, which do not correspond as such to fermions as elementary particles, there is a strong violation of isospin symmetry.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-4">The physical states are constructed using p-adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-mless-elvafu">[mless, elvafu (allb)]</a> <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> for the scaling generator \(L_0\) of the conformal symmetries extended to the space-time level and involve the action of Kac-Moody type algebras.<br>
    The basic challenge of the state construction of the physical states is to obtain physical states with correct color quantum numbers.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
        <li>General irrep of SU(3) is labelled by a pair (p,q) of integers, where p resp. q corresponds intuitively to the number of quarks resp. antiquarks. The dimension of the representation is \(d(p,q) = (1/2)(p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2)\).<br>
        The spinors assignable to left and right handed neutrino correspond to representations of color group of type (p,p), where the integers and only right-handed neutrino allows singlet (0,0) as covariantly constant \(CP_2\) spinor mode. (1,1) corresponds to octet 8. Charged leptons allow representations of type (3+p,p): p=0 corresponds to decuplet 10.<br>
        Note that (0,3) corresponds to \(\overline{10}\).<br>
        Quarks correspond to irreps of type obtained from leptons by adding one quarks that is replacing (p+3,p) with (p+4,p) (p=0 gives d=20) or (p,p) with (p+1,p) (p=1 gives d=42). Antiquarks are obtained by replacing (p,p+3) replaced with (p,p+4) and (p,p) with (p,p+1).</li>
        <li>Physical leptons (quarks) are color singlets (triplets). One can imagine two ways to achieve this.
            <p class="mt-2"><b>Option I:</b> The conformal generators act on the ground state defined by the spinor harmonic of H. Could the tensor product of the conformal generators with spinor modes give a color singlet state for leptons and triplet state for quarks? The constraint that Kac-Moody type generators annihilate the physical states, realizing conformal invariance, might pose severe difficulties.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">In fact, TGD leads to the proposal that there is a hierarchical symmetry breaking for conformal half-algebras containing a hierarchy of isomorphic sub-algebras with conformal weights coming as multiplets of the weights of the entire algebra. This would make the gauge symmetry of the subalgebra with weights below given maximal weight to a physical symmetry.</p>
            <p class="mt-2"><b>Option II:</b> The proposal is that the wormhole throats also contain pairs of left- and right-handed neutrinos guaranteeing that the total electroweak quantum numbers of the string-like closed monopole flux tube representing hadron vanishes. This would make the weak interactions short-ranged with the range determined by the length of the string-like object.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">One must study the tensor products of \(\nu_L\overline{\nu}_R\) and \(\overline{\nu}_L\nu_R\) states with the leptonic (quark) spinor harmonic to see whether it is possible to obtain singlet (triplet) states. The tensor product of a neutrino octet with a neutrino type spinor contains a color singlet. The tensor product \(8\otimes 8 = 1+8_A+8_S+10+\overline{10}+27\) contains \(\overline{10}\) and its tensor product with 10 for quark contains a color triplet.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-4">The ground states for the Super Virasoro representations correspond to spinor harmonics in \(M^4 \times CP_2\) characterized by momentum and color quantum numbers. The correlation between color and electro-weak quantum numbers is wrong for the spinor harmonics and these states would be also hyper-massive. One can imagine two mechanisms.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
        <li>The super-symplectic generators could allow to build color triplet states having negative vacuum conformal weights, and their values are such that p-adic massivation is consistent with the predictions of the earlier model differing from the recent one in the quark sector. In the following the construction and the properties of the color partial waves for fermions and bosons are considered. The discussion follows closely to the discussion of <a href="#ref-bmat-Pope">[Pope (bmat)]</a>.</li>
        <li>In the concrete model for elementary particles a pair of left- and right-handed neutrino associated with the monopole flux tube screens weak isospin above weak boson Compton length. This pair could be in such color partial waves that the outcome is leptonic color singlet and quark color triplet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-4">In the sequel only the color partial waves in H are discussed. This reduces to the discussion of the eigenstates of \(CP_2\) d'Alembertian whose eigestates the spinor harmonics are.</p>

        <li>d'Alembertian corresponds to a massless wave equation \(M^4 \times CP_2\) and thus Kaluza-Klein picture applies, that is \(M^4_+\) mass is generated from the momentum in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This implies mass quantization:<br>

        where \(M_n^2\) are eigenvalues of \(CP_2\) Laplacian. Here of course, ordinary field theory is considered. In TGD the vacuum weight changes mass squared spectrum.</li>
        <li>In order to get a respectable spinor structure in \(CP_2\) one must couple \(CP_2\) spinors to an odd integer multiple of the Kähler gauge potential. Leptons and quarks correspond to n=3 and n=1 couplings respectively. The spectrum of the electromagnetic charge comes out correctly for leptons and quarks.</li>
        <li>Right handed neutrino is covariantly constant solution of \(CP_2\) Laplacian for n=3 coupling to Kähler gauge potential whereas right handed "electron" corresponds to the covariantly constant solution for n=-3. From the covariant constancy it follows that all solutions of the spinor Laplacian are obtained from these two basic solutions by multiplying with an appropriate solution of the scalar Laplacian coupled to Kähler gauge potential with such a coupling that a correct total Kähler charge results. Left handed solutions of spinor Laplacian are obtained simply by multiplying right handed solutions with \(CP_2\) Dirac operator: in this operation the eigenvalues of the mass squared operator are obviously preserved.</li>
        <li>The remaining task is to solve scalar Laplacian coupled to an arbitrary integer multiple of Kähler gauge potential. This can be achieved by noticing that the solutions of the massive \(CP_2\) Laplacian can be regarded as solutions of \(S^5\) scalar Laplacian. \(S^5\) can indeed be regarded as a circle bundle over \(CP_2\) and massive solutions of \(CP_2\) Laplacian correspond to the solutions of \(S^5\) Laplacian with \(\exp(is\tau)\) dependence on \(S^1\) coordinate such that s corresponds to the coupling to the Kähler gauge potential:<br>

        for the assumed dependence on \(\tau\).</li>
        <li>What remains to do, is to find the spectrum of \(S^5\) Laplacian and this is an easy task. All solutions of \(S^5\) Laplacian can be written as homogenous polynomial functions of \(C^3\) complex coordinates \(Z^k\) and their complex conjugates and have a decomposition into the representations of SU(3) acting in natural manner in \(C^3\).</li>
        <li>The solutions of the scalar Laplacian belong to the representations (p,p+s) for \(s \ge 0\) and to the representations \((p+|s|, p)\) of SU(3) for \(s \le 0\). The eigenvalues \(m^2(s)\) and degeneracies d are<br>

    <p>Left handed quarks are obtained by applying Dirac operator to right handed quark states and mass formulas and color partial wave spectrum are the same as for right handed quarks.</p>
    <p>The color contributions to p-adic mass squared are integer valued if \(m_0^2/3\) is taken as a fundamental p-adic unit of mass squared. This choice has an obvious relevance for p-adic mass calculations since canonical identification does not commute with a division by integer. More precisely, the images of number xp in canonical identification has a value of order 1 when x is a non-trivial rational whereas for x=np the value is n/p and extremely is small for physically interesting primes. This choice does not however affect the spectrum of massless states but can affect the spectrum of light states in case of electro-weak gauge bosons.</p>
