<p>The discussions with the Zoom group (Marko Manninen, Tuomas Sorakivi, Ville-Veli Saari and Rode Majakka) have been very useful since they have forced to explain various TGD related concepts. The attempt to calculate the fermionic Dirac propagator with the assistance of GPT together with Tuomas forced to formulate this notion precisely and this led to some surprising conclusions discussed in this article.</p>
