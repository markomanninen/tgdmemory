    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">2. How does the propagation take place?</h2>
    <p>I have considered two alternative views concerning what fermion propagation could mean.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Fermions propagate along the 4-D space-time surface \(X^4\) as induced spinor fields and the propagator is defined by the analog of 4-D massless Dirac operator.</li>
        <li>Fermions propagate in H and virtuality in geometric sense could mean that they can leave the space-time surface during the propagation. Off mass-shell property would mean off-space-time surface.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Could the two interpretations for the fermion propagation be consistent? The space-time propagation as a 4-D propagation is geometrically much more restricted. Could the propagator code for the information about initial and final quantum states as a kind of quantum-classical correspondence?</p>

    <h3 id="leptons-quarks-quantized" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">2.1 Leptons and quarks as quantized free spinor fields in H</h3>
    <p>It is good to start with the description of H spinor fields and of the H Dirac equation. This topic is also discussed in Appendix A.</p>

    <h4 id="leptons-quarks-h-spinors" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.1.1 Leptons and quarks as H spinors with different H chiralities</h4>
    <p>Consider first the general theory.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The second quantized spinor field in \(H=M^4 \times CP_2\) can be written as superpositions of modes multiplied with a creation or annihilation operator.</li>
        <li>Suppose that the spinor fields of H have a definite H-chirality so that they are either leptonic or quark-like, not a superposition of the two: this would violate the superselection rule of charge and fermion number.
        One has

        <li>The Dirac equation is satisfied by the spinor modes of H. They are massless in H but not in \(M^4\)(!). This is essential for the twistorization and the divergence-free nature of the theory.
        The Dirac operator is

        </div>
        is the Dirac operator in \(CP_2\). Here \(D_k\) is covariant derivative, which is defined by the spinor connection of \(CP_2\) that encodes electroweak interactions. The Kähler gauge potential \(A_k\) for leptons is \(3A_k\) and for quarks \(A_k\). This explains the different electric charges of quarks and leptons.
        Twistorialization suggests that \(M^4\) allows the analog of Kähler structure whereas vielbein connection should be trivial by the flatness of the metric. Kähler form should satisfy the analog self-duality meaning that locally it is analogous to mutually orthogonal electric and magnetic fields of the same magnitude.</li>
        <li>Quarks correspond to triality t=1 partial waves and leptons to triality t=0 partial waves. These modes are not simply color triplets for physical quarks and color singlets for physical leptons. For physical fermions, a mechanism producing color triplets for quarks and singlets for leptons is needed.
        According to the first section of the Appendix, the color partial waves with different charges correspond to color partial waves characterized by an integer pair (p,q). p and q can thought of as giving the numbers of triplets and anti-triplets in the tensor containing the representation in question. The dimension of the color representation is \(d(p,q) = (1/2)(p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2)\).
        In the case of leptons, one has representations (p,p) for neutrinos and (3+p,p) for charged leptons. The dimensions are \((p+1)^2(p+2)\) for neutrinos and \((3+p+1)(p+1)(p+2)\) for charged leptons (Mistake in original formula, should be \((3+p+1)(p+1)(p+2)\) or similar based on (p,q) general formula, \(d(3+p,p) = 1/2 (p+4)(p+1)(2p+5)\) ). The color representations are the same for both \(CP_2\) chiralities which correspond to opposite \(M^4\) chiralities for a fixed H chirality.
        In the case of quarks one has representations (p+1,p) and (p+4,p) for D resp. U type quarks and the corresponding dimensions are \(1/2(p+2)(p+1)(2p+3)\) resp. \(1/2(p+5)(p+1)(2p+5)\). The two \(CP_2\) chiralities are transformed to each other by \(D(CP_2)\): covariantly right-handed neutrino is an exception since it is annihilated by \(D(CP_2)\).</li>
        <li>The charge assignable to color partial wave is not a local notion characterized by a spinor index since \(D(CP_2)\) mixes different isospin states, whose identification depends on the choice of the vierbein in \(CP_2\). This is understandable since the choice of the \(CP_2\) spinor basis is determined apart from a local U(2) rotation. The same problem is encountered in standard model and solved by going to unitary gauge. One can ask whether it might be possible to define the counterpart of the unitary gauge as a global choice of \(CP_2\) vierbein for which the \(CP_2\) spinor is constant or covariantly constant for a given color partial wave.</li>

    <h3 id="propagation-along-x4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">2.2 Does the propagation take place along space-time surface \(X^4\)?</h3>
    <p>For the modes of the induced spinor field the propagation would take place along the spacetime surface and possibly also along a related lower-dimensional surface such as a partonic 2-surface and light-like curves along it.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>This 4-dimensional (or possibly lower-dimensional) propagator corresponds to the inverse of the Dirac operator for the induced gamma matrices as projection of the 8-D vector formed by H gamma matrices. Induced gamma matrices anticommute to the induced metric.</li>
        <li>One can also consider modified gamma matrices determined as contractions of the canonical momentum currents of the classical action with the gamma matrices of H <a href="#ref-allb-cspin">[cspin, wcwnew (allb)]</a>. These do not anticommute to the induced metric but for them 4-D super-conformal symmetry would be exact and classical field equations would appear as a consistency condition guaranteeing hermiticity.
        For the induced gamma matrices super-conformal symmetry is violated at the vertices <a href="#ref-btart-whatgravitons">[whatgravitons (btart)]</a>, where the full action makes itself visible: outside the singularities minimal surface property consistent with volume action, giving rise to induced gamma matrices, holds true.</li>
        <li>The beauty of this view (also that based on H propagator) is that the constructions of the propagator and of the physical states are completely separated from each other. The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator for induced spinors. For H propagator the construction is easy but the situation need not be the same now.</li>
        <li>One might hope that holography=holomorphy principle <a href="#ref-btart-Frenkel">[Frenkel, Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> allows the explicit construction of the propagator using complex coordinates assignable to the Hamilton-Jacobi structure involving hypercomplex coordinates (u,v) and complex coordinates (w,\(\bar{w}\)) <a href="#ref-btart-HJ">[HJ (btart)]</a>. Hypercomplex coordinates (u,v) would be the analogs of light-like coordinates and the Minkowskian signature would make the propagation possible.
        In the Euclidean situation the propagator would be bilinear in holomorphic and antiholomorphic modes \(h_1=h_2\) would be a delta function singularity. Now the situation is more complex but one might hope that Wick rotation for the second complex coordinate, transforming it to hypercomplex coordinate, could give the propagator.
        For light-like curves at partonic orbits identified as fermionic lines, the propagator can be constructed explicitly by a semiclassical argument.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One can criticize this approach.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In the case of Minkowski space it is clear what virtuality of the fermion means for the massless case: the explicit expression for the massless fermion propagator implies the massive virtual modes. For virtual modes with \(p^2 \neq 0\) \(p^k\gamma_k\Psi\) is nonvanishing.</li>
        <li>What could the non-vanishing virtual momentum squared correspond to in the recent case? The condition \(D\Psi = (\Gamma^k D_k + \Gamma^{\bar{k}} D_{\bar{k}})\Psi = 0\), reduces for the holomorphic modes, satisfying \(D_{\bar{k}}\Psi=0\), to the condition \(\Gamma^k\Psi=0\). An analogous condition is true for the antiholomorphic modes.
        \(\Gamma^k\Psi \neq 0\) should be true for the virtual modes. This condition is consistent with the condition that H chirality is fixed but means mixing of the \(M^4\) chiralities which is the signature of massivation due to the virtual mass.</li>

    <h3 id="propagation-in-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">2.3 Does the propagation occur in H?</h3>
    <p>The second option is that the propagation takes place in H for the spinor modes of H in such a way that only the endpoints of the propagator \(D_F(h_1,h_2)\) are restricted to the space-time surface \(X^4\). One could say that virtuality in geometric sense for the fermions means that they can leave the space-time surface. The propagation along space-time surface already discussed would mean the analog of on-mass-shell propagation.</p>

    <h4 id="deduction-h-propagator" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">2.3.2 Deduction of the H propagator</h4>
    <p>The separate conservation of lepton and quark numbers forces the counterpart of the massless propagator, not only in H but also in \(M^4\).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The H propagator corresponds to the inverse of the massless Dirac operator of H. It is essential that the modes have a well-defined H-chirality meaning that lepton and quarks numbers are separately conserved.</li>
        <li>One could argue that since \(M^4\) masses for spinor modes are given by \(p^2=\Lambda_n^2\), where \(\Lambda_n^2\) is the eigenvalue of \(D(CP_2)^2\), each mode gives rise to a propagator with mass \(\Lambda_n^2\). Since \(\Lambda_n\) corresponds to \(CP_2\) mass scale, only the covariantly constant right-handed neutrino would propagate above \(CP_2\) mass scale! The other modes would propagate only in the \(CP_2\) length scale. Note however that in \(M^4\) massive propagation along light-like geodesics reduces to massless propagation.
        The second problem is that for this view the poles at \(p^2=\Lambda_n^2\) do not emerge and must be put in by hand as normalization factors for off-mass-shell states. The reason is that the \(1/D^2\) factor disappears in the matrix elements of \(D/(D^2+i\epsilon)\) between the massive H spinor modes \(\Psi\), which are of form \(\Psi=D\Phi\). The only exception is the right-handed neutrino, which is covariantly constant in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. Only the right-handed neutrino would propagate.
        The delicate difference with respect to the ordinary massive propagation in \(M^4\) is that the ordinary massive propagator is given by \(D_F=1/(p^k\gamma_k+m) = (p^k\gamma_k-m)/(p^2-m^2+i\epsilon)\) by \(p^2-m^2=(p^k\gamma_k+m)(p^k\gamma_k-m)\). In TGD, a propagator massive in \(M^4\) sense is massless in the 8-D sense and one has \(D_F=1/D = D/(D^2+i\epsilon)\).</li>
        <li>What does the fixing the H-chirality implied by the separate conservation of quark and lepton numbers mean? The H-spinor is a combination of two spinors, where the \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities \(\epsilon_1\) and \(\epsilon_2\) are well defined and their product \(\epsilon=\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\) is +1 or -1 depending on whether it is a quark or a lepton. The combinations (1,-1) and (-1,1) and on the other hand (1,1) and (-1,-1) are possible.
        But the fixed \(M^4\) chirality means that propagation is like that for a massless fermion in \(M^4\)! The mass spectrum for \(D(P_2)\) does not show itself in the \(M^4\) part of the propagator and the construction of states and of the propagator are completely separate problems. This picture also corresponds to the picture of QCD where massless quarks are assumed as an approximation.</li>
        <li>What about the propagation in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom? It follows directly from the defining condition that the propagator is a delta function in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. There is no propagation at all. This just what the Euclidian signature of \(CP_2\) suggests. The matrix elements of the propagator between quantum states constructed from the conformal representations having H spinor modes as ground states are extremely simple and reduce to the same form as in QFTs for fermions with internal quantum numbers.</li>

    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The H propagation includes the constraint that the end points of the propagator belong to the space-time surface through the fact that \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) are on the same spacetime surface. Since there is no propagation at all in \(CP_2\) the points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are identical!
        The condition \(s_1=s_2\) at the spacetime surface gives two complex conditions for \(s_2\) when \(s_1\) is fixed and the result is a discrete set of points on the spacetime surface! Only in these cases does propagation occur. The theory discretizes itself in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom! Discretization would not be an approximation but a prediction of the theory. This is the basic idea behind the identification of cognitive representation as a number theoretic discretization using points of the embedding space for which H coordinates make sense both as real numbers and numbers in an extension of p-adic numbers.</li>
        <li>The light-like parton orbits are in a special role now since the partonic 2-surfaces at the ends of the parton orbit can have a large number of common points if their \(CP_2\) projections are identical. This would explain why they are physically in exceptional position.
        The picture of propagation along light-like geodesics suggest by physical intuition is consistent with the condition \(s_1=s_2\) but a light-like geodesic is not needed for the H-propagator.</li>
        <li>From this it should be easy to understand what happens in quark and color confinement (gluons are bound states of quarks and antiquarks in TGD). The classical time evolution involves the failure of classical determinism identifiable as p-adic non-determinism <a href="#ref-btart-Langlands2025">[Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a>. There is a sequence of analogs of multifurcations involving non-determinism. In this sequence the number of common points possessed by the initial and final partonic orbits decreases and eventually the propagator amplitude becomes very small. This means color confinement.</li>
