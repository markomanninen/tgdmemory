    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">3. A model for 4-D propagation as a propagation along light-like geodesics of H</h2>
    <p>The previous considerations favor H propagation with the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) implying that no propagation takes place in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This means that the propagation takes place along \(M^4\) geodesics.</p>
    <p>The 4-D propagation along \(X^4\) involves induced spinor structure and my intuitive feeling is that also this perspective is important, at least as semiclassical model. The condition \(s_1 = s_2\) for H propagation suggests that fermion propagation is always 1-dimensional and along a light-like geodesic of H. This would give a very concrete classical view of the propagation even if a 4-D propagator were not useful. In particular, the p-adic thermal massivation could be modelled semi-classically.</p>

    <h3 id="identify-4d-propagator-lightlike-geodesics" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.1 Can one identify the 4-D propagator as a propagator along light-like geodesics of H?</h3>
    <p>The 4-D variant of the propagator could be identified as a propagator along light-like geodesics of H. This idea has been already mentioned.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The light-like geodesics of H are of form \((m(t), s(t))\), where \(m(t)\) is a light-like geodesic of \(M^4\) and \(s(t)\) is a geodesic of \(CP_2\). For \(s(t)\) there are two options. It is either a geodesic circle or a point.</li>
        <li>The condition \(s_1 = s_2\) for H-propagator means that \(s(t)\) must be a point of \(CP_2\). Hence the propagation takes place along light-like geodesics of \(M^4\) for a fixed point of \(CP_2\). This is not quite the original idea.</li>
        <li>The original idea was that the propagation takes place along light-like geodesics of \(X^4 \subset H\). This means that \((m(t), s(t))\) belongs to \(X^4\). This implies constraints. For instance, for cosmic strings \(X^2 \times Y^2 \subset M^4 \times CP_2\), \(s(t)\) must belong to \(Y^2\), which is a complex submanifold of \(CP_2\). If \(Y^2\) is a geodesic sphere \(S^2_I\) or \(S^{II}\), then \(s(t)\) can be any geodesic of \(Y^2\). If \(Y^2\) is a point, this case reduces to the previous one.</li>
        <li>The intuitive picture is that the lines of generalized Feynman diagrams are light-like geodesics of H. This means that the points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are points of \(CP_2\) rather than general points of H. This is achieved if the H-propagator is proportional to \(\delta^4(s_1 − s_2)\) as the Euclidean signature of \(CP_2\) metric suggests.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="explicit-form-propagator-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.2 Explicit form of the propagator in H</h3>
    <p>The explicit form of the H propagator with fixed H-chirality is proportional to</p>
    <div class="explainable-equation-container" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} S_F (h_1, h_2) = \gamma^k(\partial_k\delta^8(h_1 − h_2))\delta(s_1, s_2) . \end{equation}" title="Propagator in H">
        <p class="equation">$$ \begin{equation} S_F (h_1, h_2) = \gamma^k(\partial_k\delta^8(h_1 − h_2))\delta(s_1, s_2) . \end{equation} $$</p>
        <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
    </div>
    <p>Here \(\gamma^k\) are H gamma matrices. \(\delta(s_1, s_2)\) is delta function in \(CP_2\). This propagator is for a fixed H-chirality.</p>
    <p>The integration of \(S_F (h_1, h_2)\) over \(h_2\) gives \(\gamma^k(\partial_k\delta^4(m_1 − m_2))\) so that the propagator is indeed the \(M^4\) part of the H propagator.</p>

    <h3 id="how-padic-mass-scale-emerges" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.3 How does the p-adic mass scale emerge?</h3>
    <p>The p-adic mass scale emerges from p-adic thermodynamics for the representations of superconformal algebras. This means that the states are thermal mixtures of states with different masses. This is a quantum statistical description and the question is what is the geometric meaning of the p-adic mass.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The H-propagator is massless. How can it give rise to massive propagation effectively? In the description of particle reactions, one sums over intermediate states which are on mass shell states with p-adic thermal mass. This is a possible answer.</li>
        <li>At the semi-classical level the light-like geodesics of \(M^4\) are replaced with time-like geodesics in \(M^4\) for a particle with p-adic thermal mass. For instance, in the case of cosmic string \(X^2 \times Y^2\), the string \(X^2\) is a time-like geodesic surface (string world sheet). The projection of the light-like geodesic of H to \(M^4\) is a time-like geodesic. This is like the description of massive particle in terms of 5-D light-like geodesic in Kaluza-Klein theories.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The p-adic length scale hypothesis states that the p-adic primes p associated with elementary particles are near powers of 2: \(p \approx 2^k\), k prime. For instance, for electron k = 127. This is one of the key predictions of TGD.</p>
