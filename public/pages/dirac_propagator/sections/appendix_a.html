    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">Appendix A: About the solutions of Dirac equation in H</h2>
    <p>This section serves as an Appendix and re-represents information appearing in <a href="#ref-allb-mless">[mless (allb)]</a>. First the TGD view of electroweak and color interactions is compared with the standard view. After that the general solutions of the Dirac equation in H are discussed.</p>

    <h3 id="tgd-vs-standard-model" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">A.1 How does the TGD view of standard model interactions differ from the standard model view?</h3>
    <p>TGD based vision standard model interactions differs in several respects from the standard view.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>In TGD, elementary particles correspond to closed monopole flux tubes as analogs of hadronic strings connecting two Minkowskian space-time sheets by Euclidean wormhole contacts. The light-like orbits of wormhole throats (partonic orbits) carry fermions and antifermions at light curves located at light-like 3-surfaces, which define interfaces between Minkowskian string world regions and Euclidean regions identified as deformed \(CP_2\) type extremals.</li>
        <li>The basic difference at the level of H spinor fields is that color quantum numbers are not spin-like but are replaced with color partial waves in \(CP_2\). Color degrees of freedom are analogous to the rotational degrees of freedom of a rigid body. An infinite number of color partial waves emerges for both quarks and leptons. In TGD, color and electroweak degrees of freedom are strongly correlated as is also clear from the fact that color symmetries correspond to the non-broken symmetries as isometries of \(CP_2\) and electroweak symmetries correspond to the holonomies of \(CP_2\), which are automatically broken gauge symmetries.<br>
        The spectrum of color partial waves in H is different for U and D type quarks and for charged leptons and neutrinos. The triality of the partial wave is zero for leptons and 1 resp. -1 for quarks resp. antiquarks. At the level of fundamental fermions, which do not correspond as such to fermions as elementary particles, there is a strong violation of isospin symmetry.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-4">The physical states are constructed using p-adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-mless-elvafu">[mless, elvafu (allb)]</a> <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> for the scaling generator \(L_0\) of the conformal symmetries extended to the space-time level and involve the action of Kac-Moody type algebras.<br>
    The basic challenge of the state construction of the physical states is to obtain physical states with correct color quantum numbers.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
        <li>General irrep of SU(3) is labelled by a pair (p,q) of integers, where p resp. q corresponds intuitively to the number of quarks resp. antiquarks. The dimension of the representation is \(d(p,q) = (1/2)(p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2)\).<br>
        The spinors assignable to left and right handed neutrino correspond to representations of color group of type (p,p), where the integers and only right-handed neutrino allows singlet (0,0) as covariantly constant \(CP_2\) spinor mode. (1,1) corresponds to octet 8. Charged leptons allow representations of type (3+p,p): p=0 corresponds to decuplet 10.<br>
        Note that (0,3) corresponds to \(\overline{10}\).<br>
        Quarks correspond to irreps of type obtained from leptons by adding one quarks that is replacing (p+3,p) with (p+4,p) (p=0 gives d=20) or (p,p) with (p+1,p) (p=1 gives d=42). Antiquarks are obtained by replacing (p,p+3) replaced with (p,p+4) and (p,p) with (p,p+1).</li>
        <li>Physical leptons (quarks) are color singlets (triplets). One can imagine two ways to achieve this.
            <p class="mt-2"><b>Option I:</b> The conformal generators act on the ground state defined by the spinor harmonic of H. Could the tensor product of the conformal generators with spinor modes give a color singlet state for leptons and triplet state for quarks? The constraint that Kac-Moody type generators annihilate the physical states, realizing conformal invariance, might pose severe difficulties.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">In fact, TGD leads to the proposal that there is a hierarchical symmetry breaking for conformal half-algebras containing a hierarchy of isomorphic sub-algebras with conformal weights coming as multiplets of the weights of the entire algebra. This would make the gauge symmetry of the subalgebra with weights below given maximal weight to a physical symmetry.</p>
            <p class="mt-2"><b>Option II:</b> The proposal is that the wormhole throats also contain pairs of left- and right-handed neutrinos guaranteeing that the total electroweak quantum numbers of the string-like closed monopole flux tube representing hadron vanishes. This would make the weak interactions short-ranged with the range determined by the length of the string-like object.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">One must study the tensor products of \(\nu_L\overline{\nu}_R\) and \(\overline{\nu}_L\nu_R\) states with the leptonic (quark) spinor harmonic to see whether it is possible to obtain singlet (triplet) states. The tensor product of a neutrino octet with a neutrino type spinor contains a color singlet. The tensor product \(8\otimes 8 = 1+8_A+8_S+10+\overline{10}+27\) contains \(\overline{10}\) and its tensor product with 10 for quark contains a color triplet.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-4">The ground states for the Super Virasoro representations correspond to spinor harmonics in \(M^4 \times CP_2\) characterized by momentum and color quantum numbers. The correlation between color and electro-weak quantum numbers is wrong for the spinor harmonics and these states would be also hyper-massive. One can imagine two mechanisms.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
        <li>The super-symplectic generators could allow to build color triplet states having negative vacuum conformal weights, and their values are such that p-adic massivation is consistent with the predictions of the earlier model differing from the recent one in the quark sector. In the following the construction and the properties of the color partial waves for fermions and bosons are considered. The discussion follows closely to the discussion of <a href="#ref-bmat-Pope">[Pope (bmat)]</a>.</li>
        <li>In the concrete model for elementary particles a pair of left- and right-handed neutrino associated with the monopole flux tube screens weak isospin above weak boson Compton length. This pair could be in such color partial waves that the outcome is leptonic color singlet and quark color triplet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-4">In the sequel only the color partial waves in H are discussed. This reduces to the discussion of the eigenstates of \(CP_2\) d'Alembertian whose eigestates the spinor harmonics are.</p>

    <h3 id="general-construction-dirac-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">A.2 General construction of solutions of Dirac operator of H</h3>
    <p>The construction of the solutions of massless spinor and other d'Alembertians in \(M^4_+ \times CP_2\) is based on the following observations.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>d'Alembertian corresponds to a massless wave equation \(M^4 \times CP_2\) and thus Kaluza-Klein picture applies, that is \(M^4_+\) mass is generated from the momentum in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This implies mass quantization:<br>
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Mass quantization formula" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} M^2 = M_n^2 \end{equation}">
            <p class="equation">$$ \begin{equation} M^2 = M_n^2 \end{equation} $$</p>
            <span class="equation-explainer-trigger">?</span>
        </div>
        where \(M_n^2\) are eigenvalues of \(CP_2\) Laplacian. Here of course, ordinary field theory is considered. In TGD the vacuum weight changes mass squared spectrum.</li>
        <li>In order to get a respectable spinor structure in \(CP_2\) one must couple \(CP_2\) spinors to an odd integer multiple of the Kähler gauge potential. Leptons and quarks correspond to n=3 and n=1 couplings respectively. The spectrum of the electromagnetic charge comes out correctly for leptons and quarks.</li>
        <li>Right handed neutrino is covariantly constant solution of \(CP_2\) Laplacian for n=3 coupling to Kähler gauge potential whereas right handed "electron" corresponds to the covariantly constant solution for n=-3. From the covariant constancy it follows that all solutions of the spinor Laplacian are obtained from these two basic solutions by multiplying with an appropriate solution of the scalar Laplacian coupled to Kähler gauge potential with such a coupling that a correct total Kähler charge results. Left handed solutions of spinor Laplacian are obtained simply by multiplying right handed solutions with \(CP_2\) Dirac operator: in this operation the eigenvalues of the mass squared operator are obviously preserved.</li>
        <li>The remaining task is to solve scalar Laplacian coupled to an arbitrary integer multiple of Kähler gauge potential. This can be achieved by noticing that the solutions of the massive \(CP_2\) Laplacian can be regarded as solutions of \(S^5\) scalar Laplacian. \(S^5\) can indeed be regarded as a circle bundle over \(CP_2\) and massive solutions of \(CP_2\) Laplacian correspond to the solutions of \(S^5\) Laplacian with \(\exp(is\tau)\) dependence on \(S^1\) coordinate such that s corresponds to the coupling to the Kähler gauge potential:<br>

        for the assumed dependence on \(\tau\).</li>
        <li>What remains to do, is to find the spectrum of \(S^5\) Laplacian and this is an easy task. All solutions of \(S^5\) Laplacian can be written as homogenous polynomial functions of \(C^3\) complex coordinates \(Z^k\) and their complex conjugates and have a decomposition into the representations of SU(3) acting in natural manner in \(C^3\).</li>
        <li>The solutions of the scalar Laplacian belong to the representations (p,p+s) for \(s \ge 0\) and to the representations \((p+|s|, p)\) of SU(3) for \(s \le 0\). The eigenvalues \(m^2(s)\) and degeneracies d are<br>

    <p>Quarks correspond to the second conserved H-chirality of H-spinors. The construction of the color partial waves for quarks proceeds along similar lines as for leptons.

    <p>The color contributions to p-adic mass squared are integer valued if \(m_0^2/3\) is taken as a fundamental p-adic unit of mass squared. This choice has an obvious relevance for p-adic mass calculations since canonical identification does not commute with a division by integer. More precisely, the images of number xp in canonical identification has a value of order 1 when x is a non-trivial rational whereas for x=np the value is n/p and extremely is small for physically interesting primes. This choice does not however affect the spectrum of massless states but can affect the spectrum of light states in case of electro-weak gauge bosons.</p>
