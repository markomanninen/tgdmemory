    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
In this article the notion of fermion propagator is discussed. It is found that the construction is much more than a mere computational challenge. There are two alternative approaches. Fermionic propagation could correspond to a) a 4-D or lower-dimensional propagation at the space-time level for the induced spinor fields as analog of massless propagation or b) to 8-D propagation in \(H\) between points belonging to the space-time surface.
    </p>
    <p>
For the option b) the separate conservations of baryon and lepton number requires fixed \(H\)-chirality so that the spinor mode is sum of products of \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) spinors with fixed \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities whose product is +1 or -1. This implies that \(M^4\) propagation is massless. The Euclidean signature of \(CP_2\) in turn suggests that there is no propagation in \(CP_2\) and the \(CP_2\) projections \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) for the ends of the propagator line are the same. This allows a very simple form for the matrix elements of the propagator and the condition \(s_1=s_2\) implies that the propagation from \(s_1\) is possible to a discrete set of points \(s_2\). This has direct relevance for the understanding of color confinement and more or less implies the intuitively deduced TGD based model for elementary particles.
    </p>
    <p>
Although the option a) need not provide a realistic propagator, it could provide a very useful semiclassical picture. If the condition \(s_1=s_2\) is assumed, fermionic propagation along light-like geodesics of \(H\) is favored and in accordance with the model for elementary particles. This allows a classical space-time picture of particle massivation by p-adic thermodynamics and color confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
Also the interpretational and technical problems related to the construction of 4-D variants of super-conformal representations having spinor modes as ground states and to the p-adic thermodynamics are discussed.
