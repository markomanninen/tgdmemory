It encapsulates how a massless fermion propagates through space-time, incorporating both quantum and relativistic effects. The first part shows the propagator as a Fourier transform of the momentum-space propagator, while the second part provides a closed-form expression highlighting the singular behavior as $x$ approaches $y$.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in Massless Dirac Propagator in Space-Time</h3>\n<p>\nIn quantum field theory, propagators are fundamental objects that describe the probability amplitude for particles to travel between points. For massless Dirac particles (like neutrinos in some models), the propagator has a specific form reflecting their relativistic, massless nature. Equation 13 shows the explicit form of this propagator, emphasizing its dependence on space-time separation and its singularity structure, which is crucial for understanding interactions and field behavior at short distances.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nSuppose you want to compute the amplitude for a massless fermion to move from point $y$ to point $x$ in free space. Using the second, closed-form expression, you can directly evaluate the propagator as\n$$\nS_F(x - y) = - \\frac{i}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot (x - y)}{|x - y|^4},\n$$\nwhich shows that the propagator's magnitude diminishes with the fourth power of the distance, and its directionality is encoded in $\\gamma \\cdot (x - y)$. This form is particularly useful for analyzing short-distance behavior and singularities in quantum field calculations.\n</p>"}
