{"explanation":"<h3>Symbol Meanings</h3>\n<p>\nIn the equation $E = mc^2$, $E$ represents the total energy of an object, $m$ is its rest mass, and $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately $3 \\times 10^8$ meters per second.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Conceptual Significance</h3>\n<p>\nThis equation illustrates that mass and energy are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same physical quantity. A small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy because $c^2$ (the square of the speed of light) is a very large number, highlighting the potential energy contained within mass.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Context in Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence</h3>\n<p>\nProposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, this relation revolutionized physics by showing that mass can be viewed as condensed energy. It underpins many phenomena, from nuclear reactions in stars and reactors to particle physics, emphasizing the deep connection between mass and energy in the universe.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Brief Example</h3>\n<p>\nFor instance, if a small amount of mass, say $1$ gram ($0.001$ kg), is completely converted into energy, the energy produced would be approximately:\n</p>\n<p>\n$$\nE = 0.001 \\times (3 \\times 10^8)^2 \\approx 9 \\times 10^{13} \\text{ joules}\n$$\n</p>\n<p>\nwhich is equivalent to the energy released by about 21 megatons of TNT.\n</p>"}
