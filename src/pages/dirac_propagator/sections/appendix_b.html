    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">Appendix B. Foundational questions</h2>
    <p>There are several foundational questions involved. What is the origin of the p-adicity? What is the justification of p-adic thermodynamics and what does it have a counterpart at quantum level? What are the poorly understood aspects of p-adic thermodynamics? What is the understanding of generalized superconformal representations and possible interpretational and technical problems.</p>

    <h3 id="questions-padic-thermo" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">B.1. Questions related to the p-adic thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>The nice feature of both approaches is that the propagators carry a minimum amount of information about the quantum states at the 3-surfaces to which the end points of the propagator are associated. Therefore the construction of physical states with correct total color quantum numbers do not affect the propagators. One also circumvents the problem how to take into account the massivation by p-adic thermodynamics at the level of the fermionic propagators.</p>
    <p>This construction says nothing about how physical fermions are constructed and how the get their masses via p-adic thermodynamics.</p>

    <h4 id="origin-padic-thermo" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">B.1.1 The origin of p-adic thermodynamics</h4>
    <p>The understanding of the origin of p-adic thermodynamics is the first challenge.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In p-adic thermodynamics, the scaling generator \(L_0\) takes the role of energy as a generator of time translations. Ordinary 2-D conformal invariance requires that physical states are annihilated by \(L_0\). All states created by \(L_0\) would correspond to gauge degrees of freedom. This cannot be the case in p-adic thermodynamics.<br/>
        In TGD, the conformal algebras are replaced by half-algebras <a href="#ref-btart-wcwsymm">[wcwsymm (btart)]</a>, which allow an infinite hierarchy of sub-algebras isomorphic to the full algebra, which means that a finite-dimensional sub-algebra transforms from gauge algebra to a dynamical symmetry algebra and p-adic thermodynamics applies to states in this finite-dimensional state space.</li>
        <li>In the 2-D version of the p-adic thermodynamics, the ground state is necessarily tachyonic with a negative conformal weight representing the mass squared. The physical ground state with a vanishing mass squared is obtained by applying conformal generators with a positive conformal weight. Where do the generators with tachyonic conformal weight come from?
            <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                <li>p-Adic thermodynamics in its recent formulation <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> answers this question by extending the conformal algebra from dimension 2 to dimension 4 so that one has hypercomplex and complex coordinate and there are conformal weights associated with both of them. The 4-dimensional conformal invariance is realized in holography=holomorphy (H-H) vision involving the notion of Hamilton-Jacobi structure in an essential way <a href="#ref-brart-HJ">[HJ (brart)]</a>. There are conformal weights associated with hypercomplex resp. complex coordinates and the corresponding conformal weights are non-negative resp. negative. Their sum vanishes for massless ground states.</li>
                <li>\(M^8\)-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-TGDcritics">[TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> provides further insights to the tachyon problem. In \(M^8\), the momentum space \(M^4\) corresponds to a quaternionic subspace of octonions realized as the normal space of point y of the 4-surfaces \(Y^4 \subset M^8\). The point y carries the fermion. The 8-D mass squared always vanishes but the \(M^4\) part is in general non-vanishing. For some points \(y \in Y^4\) the normal space \(M^4\) is such that the \(E^4\) part of the 8-momentum vanishes and the particle is massless in \(M^4\) sense. This is the counterpart for the cancellation of the two conformal weights at the level of H.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="problem-superconformal" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">B.1.2 A possible problem with super-conformal representations</h4>
    <p>What about the higher conformal excitations giving rise to the p-adic thermal mass? There does not seem to be any point or need to modify the massless propagators since they are associated with the ground state of the super-conformal representations. There is however a problem.</p>
    <p>In string models the super generators \(G_n\) of Ramond representation and \(G_{n+1/2}\) of Neveu-Schwarz representation define the analog of the Dirac operator. The anticommutators \(\{G_m,G_n^\dagger\}\) and \(\{G_{m+1/2},G_{n+1/2}^\dagger\}\) give Virasoro generators \(L_n\). In the Ramond representation one has \(G_0= p^k\gamma_k +G_{vib,0}\). The Ramond representation therefore contains the ordinary Dirac operator acting in cm degrees of freedom.</p>
    <p>In p-adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-mless-padmass2022">[mless, padmass2022 (allb)]</a> based on the TGD view of conformal invariance <a href="#ref-btart-wcwsymm">[wcwsymm (btart)]</a>, the Majorana option is not possible. Since the ordinary gamma matrices do not carry a fermion number, the Ramond formula of G would involve generators with a vanishing fermion number and non-vanishing fermion number. Same applies also to \(G_n\).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>A possible solution of the problem is that super generators and their Hermitian conjugates define two kinds of supergenerators. For Ramond representation, this would also include the counterparts of ordinary gamma matrices. The algebra creating the states would involve only non-negative conformal weights and possess a fractal hierarchy of included sub-algebras isomorphic to the entire algebra.</li>
        <li>Could \(G_0\) is non-hermitian so that both \(G_0\) resp. \(G_0^\dagger\) carrying a fermion number 1 resp. -1 are allowed. The counterparts of \(M^4\) gamma matrices would be analogous to fermionic creation and annihilation operators, which would correspond to a complex structure in center-or mass degrees of freedom.<br/>
        Could the Hamilton-Jacobi structure <a href="#ref-btart-HJ">[HJ (btart)]</a> for \(M^4\) based on hyper-complex and complex structure make this possible. The conjugation for complex coordinate and its hypercomplex counterpart would correspond to the hermitian conjugation for the operators \(\gamma_u\) and \(\gamma_w\) producing \(\gamma_u^\dagger=\gamma_v\) and \(\gamma_w^\dagger=\gamma_{\bar{w}}\) for both leptonic and quark-like representations. These gamma matrices would act as quantum operators.</li>
        <li>Or are only Neveu-Schwarz representations for which all generators \(G_{n+1/2}\) can carry a well-defined fermion number possible? The problem is that in p-adic mass calculations fermions correspond to Ramond representations with different degeneracies for states with a given conformal weight.</li>
        <li>Could zero energy ontology (ZEO) <a href="#ref-alb-zeoquestions">[zeoquestions (alb)]</a> <a href="#ref-btart-zeocriticality">[zeocriticality (btart)]</a> come to rescue? Could these states be regarded as superpositions of pairs of states at opposite boundaries CD with opposite fermion numbers so that there would be no conflict with the superselection rule for fermion numbers. Could the time-like entanglement between the states at the boundaries of causal diamond (CD) relate to the p-adic thermodynamics or rather, its square root. What about the relationship to the model of superconductivity in terms of quantum coherent states of Cooper pairs?</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="origin-padicity" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">B.1.3 Questions related to the origin of p-adicity</h4>
    <p>One can also make ontological questions related to p-adicity.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>What is the origin of the p-adicity? H-H vision <a href="#ref-btart-Langlands2025">[Langlands2025, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> has led to a considerable progress in the attempts to understand the origin of p-adicity and the p-adic length scale hypothesis. The notion of functional p-adic numbers suggests how the p-adicization and adelization emerge. One can even ask whether it is necessary to introduce the p-adic and adelic variants of the embedding space in this approach.</li>
        <li>p-Adic thermodynamics is a statistical description and must be an approximation to a genuine quantal description. Quantum TGD can be formally regarded as a square root of thermodynamics at a quantum critical temperature defined by the KÃ¤hler coupling strength <a href="#ref-allb-UandM">[UandM, vNeumannnew (allb)]</a>. Could it make sense to speak of a square root of p-adic thermodynamics in which thermal probabilities correspond to quantal probabilities. Thermal state would be replaced by a quantum state. Very naively, thermodynamic weights would be replaced with their complex square roots, that is ordinary square roots involving a phase factor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="8d-relativity" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">B.2. Does 8-dimensionality imply 8-dimensional relativity?</h3>
    <p>One cannot avoid the question whether 8-dimensionality implies an 8-D generalization of relativity.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The completely new element is that at \(M^8\) level \(M^4\) as normal space is not fixed but dynamical: could one speak of relativity for mass squared? The Lorentz boosts of this relativity could correspond to the Lorentz group SO(1,7) of \(M^8\). Also \(G_2\) as a subgroup affects the \(M^4\) mass squared values since it does not leave quaternionic subspace \(M^4\) invariant although it does not affect the energy.</li>
        <li>Masslessness in the 8-D sense at \(M^8\) level forces us to challenge the assumption that the particles always have a well-defined 4-D mass squared. As a matter of fact, p-adic thermodynamics and its possible quantum variant as a square root of thermodynamics <a href="#ref-allb-UandM-vNeumannnew">[UandM, vNeumannnew (allb)]</a> already does this. Could one think that mass is more like a transversal or longitudinal momentum squared and depends on the state of motion characterized by the normal space of \(Y^4\)?</li>
        <li>What about color quantum numbers: could 8-D relativity apply even to them. This would change dramatically the views of color. In \(M^8\), SO(4) acting on \(E^4 \subset M^8\) is the counterpart of SU(3) acting in \(CP_2 \subset H\) and also as a subgroup \(SU(3) \subset G_2\) of octonion automorphisms leaving invariant the octonion unit defining \(M^4\) time direction in the normal space. \(M^4\) as a quaternionic normal space of \(Y^4\) varies and therefore also the subgroup \(SU(3) \subset G_2\). Suppose that one replaces normal space-with a new one by deforming \(Y^4\) such that the point \(y \in E^4\) is not affected. What happens?<br/>
        I have asked whether SO(4)-SU(3) duality between hadron physics and QCD type physics could correspond to \(M^8\)-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-M8H">[M8H1, M8H2, TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a>. Could \(M^8\)-H duality map the 2 Cartan quantum numbers of SO(4) representations appearing in \(M^8\) spinor harmonics to those of SU(3) representations of H spinor harmonics. Could the representations of SU(3) be restricted to the U(2) subgroup of the covering group of SO(4) in accordance with the left-right asymmetry of the standard model?<br/>
        Suppose that SO(1,7) and also \(G_2\) transformations affect the SO(4) representations. If so, then by \(M^8\)-H duality in the proposed form they also affect the SU(3) color partial waves for H spinors. By color confinement this is however not easy to observe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="m8-h-duality-consistency" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">B.3. Is the proposed picture consistent with \(M^8\)-H duality</h3>
    <p>\(M^8\)-H duality <a href="#ref-btart-TGDcritics-HHtwistor">[TGDcritics, HHtwistor (btart)]</a> plays a central role in TGD. Therefore one can also worry about whether octotwistors, which for physical states must reduce in some sense to quaternionic twistors, are a well-defined notion. The octonionic spinors must reduce to quaternionic spinors for the physical states in some sense. Massless Dirac equation must be satisfied and the analogs of the chirality conditions for H, \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) must make sense.</p>
    <p>In the sequel the massless octonionic Dirac equation will be discussed.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Octonionic and quaternionic spinors are very much analogous to the 2-spinors appearing in the definition of twistors since \(\gamma^0\) in the Dirac equation is replaced with a real octonion unit. The masslessness condition is obtained when Minkowski inner product is defined as the real part for the product of octonions. The counterparts of sigma matrices are identified as quaternions and octonions and matrix representations for the quaternionic units are not used. This allows the introduction of a commuting imaginary unit i doubling the number of degrees of freedom and replacing octospinors with their complexified counterparts.</li>
        <li>The octonionic Dirac equation looks like the ordinary Dirac equation but with gamma matrices replaced with octonionic units. The quaternionic Dirac equation involves quaternionic units but it is essential that they are not represented as matrices. This allows the introduction of imaginary uni i commuting with the quaternionic and octonionic units and implies double of the degrees of freedom so that one can have analogs of complex spinors.<br/>
        The octonionic units are analogs of Pauli sigma matrices and the first problem is caused by the lacking anticommutativity of the real unit with other octonion units. The Dirac equation however makes sense also in this case.</li>
        <li>The 8-D masslessness condition must correspond to the condition that the real part of the square of Dirac operator on spinors vanishes. For momentum eigenstates this gives the usual algebraic conditions for masslessness.</li>
        <li>H spinors have a defined H-chirality guaranteeing separate conservation of quark and lepton numbers. H-chirality \(\epsilon\) is a product \(\epsilon=\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\) of \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities. Alls these chiralities should be definable also at the level of \(M^8\). Also the octonionic Dirac equation for H spinors should be consistent with the chirality condition.
            <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                <li>The decomposition of octonion units to quaternion units \(\{1,I_k|k=1,2,3\}\) and co-quaternion units \(I_4\{1,I_k|k=1,2,3\}\) suggests the identification of the counterpart of \(\Gamma_9\). The matrix \(\Gamma_9\) is defined as the product of H gamma matrices satisfies \(\Gamma_9^2=-1\), anticommutes with H gamma matrices. H chirality corresponds to the eigenvalue of \(i\Gamma_9\) equal to \(\epsilon=\pm 1\). The eigen spinors with chirality \(\epsilon\) are of the form \((1+\epsilon i\Gamma_9)\Psi_0\).<br/>
                The spinors with fixed H-chirality are tensor products of spinors of fixed \(M^4\) chirality and \(CP_2\) chirality and the product of these chiralities defines H-chirality.</li>
                <li>The operator \(iI_4\), satisfying \((iI_4)^2=1\), is a good guess for the counterpart of \(\Gamma_9\) for the octonionic spinors. The octospinors with a fixed \(M^8\) chirality \(\epsilon\) should be of the form \((1+\epsilon iI_4)\Psi_0\). It is easy to check that for an octospinor of form \(\Psi_\epsilon=\Psi_a+I_4\Psi_b\) having a fixed chirality \(\epsilon\), one obtains

                so that the spinor is determined completely by its quaternionic part. Perhaps this might be regarded as a realization of quaterniocity.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Octonionic Dirac equation for the momentum eigenstates can be decomposed to a sum of quaternionic and co-quaternionic parts
        <div class="explainable-equation-container" title="Octonionic Dirac equation" data-latex-equation="\begin{equation} D\Psi = (p^k_1I_k + I_4p^k_2I_k)\Psi = 0 \end{equation}">
