    <p>Quantum classical correspondence suggests that the 4-D Dirac equation for the induced spinor fields at the space-time surface has a physical meaning. The condition that no propagation in \(CP_2\) occurs in H propagator suggests that the fermionic propagation in \(X^4\) reduces to 1-D propagation along light-like geodesics of H and it is interesting to look for the consequences of this assumption.</p>

    <h3 id="fermion-propagation-lightlike-geodesic-h" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">3.1 Does the notion of fermion propagation along a light-like geodesic line of H make sense?</h3>
    <p>The fermionic propagation in H looks like a realistic option and massless H- propagation could be interpreted in terms of ”off-space-time sheet” propagation as analogs of off-mass-shell propagation. On the other hand, the induction of spinor connection <a href="#ref-K9">[K9]</a>, <a href="#ref-K7">[K7]</a>, <a href="#ref-L9">[L9]</a> makes \(CP_2\) spinor fields dynamical and the induction of spinor fields can be seen as its natural fermionic counterpart. Could the solutions of the induced or modified Dirac equation as geometric analogs of on-mass shell states have a physical meaning? What makes them so attractive is the 4-D conformal invariance allowing us to construct them explicitly. Their analogs also appear in string models.</p>
    <p>There is an entire dimensional hierarchy involved: besides 4-D propagation also propagation in dimensions D = 1, 2, 3 are possible and these modes have edge states (see this) as condensed matter analogs <a href="#ref-L5">[L5]</a>. As the matrix elements for the propagation of color fermion states are expected to be very small except for fermionic lines at intersections of string world sheets and light-like partonic 2-surfaces. In the 1-D case the construction of the analog of the propagator is simple. Although the propagator might not be a useful object, the classical view about space-time propagation could be very useful and justified by quantum classical correspondence.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>1-D H propagation between \(h_1 = (m_1, s_1)\) and \(h_2 = (m_2, s_2)\) is expected to be possible only when the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) is true. The set of points \(s_2\) satisfying this condition for a given \(s_1\) is discrete. In ZEO, the H propagator defines a map between the 3-surfaces at the boundaries of CD. This suggests that 1-D propagation in \(X^4\) is preferred. At partonic 2-surfaces with 2-D \(CP_2\) projection, which does not change during the time evolution each points \(s_1\) has at least one \(s_2\). One can consider also lattice-like structures.</li>
        <li>8-D light-likeness and restriction to a fermion line suggests that this propagation is along a light-like curve of H belonging to the space-time surface. If this light-like curve is geodesic, then for for \(s_1 \neq s_2\) it is a light-like geodesic associated with \(M^4 \times S^1\), where \(S^1\) is the unique geodesic circle connecting \(s_1 \neq s_2\). For \(s_1 = s_2\) all geodesics belonging to the space-time surface are possible and even a 4-D set of geodesic circles of \(CP_2\) is possible unless one poses additional conditions. For instance, 2-D \(CP_2\) projection is such a constraint. In this kind of situation, one might speak of a resonance-like phenomenon.<br>
        Could one consider additional conditions? Light-like geodesics as basic geometric aspect of twistors has also a \(CP_2\) counterpart. For the \(CP_2\) counterpart for twistorialization <a href="#ref-L17">[L17]</a>, the geodesic lines connecting a given point to infinity of the local Eguchi-Hanson coordinates <a href="#ref-L9">[L9]</a> defining a homologically non-trivial geodesic sphere is in a special role and would correspond to the twistor sphere of the \(CP_2\) twistor space \(T(CP_2) = SU(3)/U(1) \times U(1)\). Could the limitation to this set of \(CP_2\) circles make sense? The fact that two \(CP_2\) geodesic circles always have an intersection point has a counterpart for \(M^4\) twistors: the spheres of twistor bundles for two points connected by a light-like geodesic intersect.</li>
        <li>One cannot exclude the alternative in which the propagation occurs along general light-like geodesics of \(X^4\). Also in this case the condition \(s_1 = s_2\) implies that the set of points \(s_2\) connected to point \(s_1\) is finite. This option will not be discussed in the sequel. Also in this case the resonance can take place when the \(CP_2\) projection is a geodesic sphere.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These observations provide motivations for the study of the 1-D fermionic propagation for induced spinor fields.</p>

    <p>It is interesting to study in more detail the assumption that the motion is along a light-like geodesic of \(M^4 \times S^1\).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The light-like geodesic of H makes it possible to get from the point \(s_1\) in \(CP_2\) to point satisfying in general \(s_2 \neq s_1\). In this case the velocity in \(M^4\) is less than the speed of light: \(\beta = v/c < 1\) and the \(M^4\) mass is not effectively zero as it is for a light-like geodesics of \(M^4\). It is also possible that the \(CP_2\) projection of the particle orbit wraps n times around \(S^1\) and returns to the original point in \(CP_2\). This would indeed happen if the propagator in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom reduces to a delta function. At least this assumption is a very promising simplification since the length scale of \(CP_2\) is very small compared to the length of the projection of the geodesic line in \(M^4\).</li>
        <li>The fermion can be thought of as moving along the light-like geodesic of \(M^4 \times S^1\):

        Here \(\beta\) is the particle’s velocity in \(M^4\). The projection of the particle orbit in \(CP_2\) is a geodesic circle. The starting point and end point of the propagator are on this geodesic line.</li>
        <li>Since the fermion is no longer moving along the light-like geodesic line of \(M^4\), it no longer behaves like a massless particle in \(M^4\) sense. Quantum classical correspondence suggests that this serves as a classical correlate for the mass of the particle resulting from p-adic thermodynamics. Unless \(\beta\) is very close to 1, i.e. unless the parameter \(\omega R\) is very small, there will be an exponential damping caused by the thermal mass. If p-dic thermodynamics described the situation, a reasonable guess is that the parameter \(\omega R\) is of the order of p-adic thermal mass using \(CP_2\) mass as a unit (here \(\hbar = 1\)) <a href="#ref-L6">[L6]</a>.</li>
        <li>If the \(CP_2\) propagator is approximated as or is a delta function then \(s_1 = s_2\) can be realized if the particle wraps n times around \(S^1\):

        In this case a 4-D set of circles \(S^1\) belonging to \(X^4\) is possible and one can say that a resonance occurs. For \(CP_2\) type extremals this could occur. This is also the case if the \(CP_2\) projections is a geodesic sphere. The twistorial picture would suggest that the set of circles correspond to a homologically trivial geodesic sphere of \(CP_2\) as an analog of the twistor sphere parametrizing light-like geodesics in \(M^4\).</li>

        R is the \(CP_2\) radius and the natural length unit. The result is amazingly simple. \(a/R \sim L_H/R\) could be interpreted as the ratio of the hadron sizes scale to \(CP_2\) radius. This gives estimate for n:

        which gives \(R/L_H \approx 1/(2\pi n)\). The parameter \(\omega R = \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}\) is very small: one has

        </div></li>
        <li>One can estimate the order of magnitude for \(\omega\) and therefore also for \(1 - \beta\). By quantum classical correspondence, \(\omega\) should be of the order of the p-adic mass scale \(m_q\) of quark: \(\omega \approx m_q\). This gives

        The order of magnitude is \(10^{-32}\) for \(m_H/m_q = 1\). The p-adic probabilities for the lowest excitations appearing in p-adic thermodynamics are extremely small and of this order of magnitude. This guarantees that the p-adic thermal mass coming from excitations with \(CP_2\) mass scale is of order particle mass. p-Adic length scale hypothesis \(p \approx 2^k\) gives \(m_qR \sim R/L_p \sim 1/\sqrt{p} = 2^{-k/2}\).

    <p>It is not at all clear whether the propagator in \(X^4\) or along light-like geodesics of H is a useful concept. It is however interesting to see whether one could define and calculate the propagator for the Dirac operator associated with the induced spinor fields. There is dimensional hierarchy: 4-D propagator, 2-D propagator at string world sheets, and 1-D propagator at fermion lines. Perhaps also 3-D propagator at partonic orbits. Holography= holomorphy vision could make it possible to solve the propagator in terms of holomorphic solutions of the modified Dirac equation.</p>

This suggests that \(D_t\Psi = 0\) or \(\Gamma_t\Psi = 0\) as a counterpart of the Dirac equation or both of them are true for fermionic on-mass-shell states. The condition \(\Gamma_t\Psi = 0\) as the analog of \(\gamma^k p_k\Psi = 0\) would fix a definite H chirality correlating \(M^4\) and \(CP_2\) chiralities and should hold true also for off-mass-shell states.
