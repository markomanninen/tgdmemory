    <p>In this article the identification and calculation of the fermion propagator \(S_F(h_1,h_2)\) in \(H=M^4 \times CP_2\) is discussed in detail. Also the definition of fermion propagator at space-time surface is considered.</p>

    <h3 id="basic-questions" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">1.1 Basic questions</h3>
    <p>Let us summarize the basic physical picture first. The following picture is only one of the many variants and must of course be taken with reservations.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The TGD view of fundamental interactions <a href="#ref-btart-TGD2024I">[TGD2024I, TGD2024II (btart)]</a> differs from that of the standard model. The notion of color differs from that of QCD and electroweak gauge potentials correspond to the components of the induced spinor connection of \(CP_2\) <a href="#ref-allb-tgdnewphys">[tgdnewphys1, tgdnewphys2 (allb)]</a>. A strong correlation between mass, color quantum numbers and electroweak quantum numbers at the fundamental level corresponding to space-time surfaces is predicted <a href="#ref-btart-isospinbreak">[isospinbreak (btart)]</a>. The standard view emerges as an approximation at the QFT limit.</li>
        <li>In \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom, well-defined H chirality implies that the H propagator \(D_F((m_1,s_1),(m_2,s_2))\) is reduced to a bilocal inner product for the two modes with the same \(CP_2\) chirality defined by the propagator factor associated with the propagator. An important constraint is that the end points are restricted to the space-time surface. If the propagator reduces to the delta function in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom, as the Euclidean metric suggests, one has \(s_1=s_2\) with very powerful consequences. Second important point is that in \(M^4\) the propagation is between identical \(M^4\) chiralities by the separate conservation of lepton and quark quantum numbers.</li>
        <li>What does one mean with a virtual fermion now? Propagation in H is the natural geometric definition for virtuality. The first naive guess was that the virtual fermions correspond to masses \(p^2=\Lambda_n^2\), \(\Lambda_n^2\) is the eigenvalue of the \(CP_2\) Dirac operator, as predicted by the H Dirac equation in H.
        This however leads to a conclusion that the propagator does not have these masses as poles unless the normalization of the mass shell states is such that poles are there. Furthermore, these masses do not correspond to the masses of physical fermion, which are generated by p-adic thermodynamics. This picture looks therefore unphysical.</li>
        <li>The condition that quark and lepton numbers are separately conserved forces us to assume a fixed H-chirality so that fermions are massless in 8-D sense. This implies that the spinor modes are superpositions of modes for which \(M^4\) chirality and \(CP_2\) chirality are well-defined and either the same or opposite depending on whether quark or lepton is in question. Fixed \(M^4\) chirality requires a massless propagation in \(M^4\). This is a rather dramatic prediction and means that propagation completely separates from the properties and construction of states.
        \(CP_2\) has Euclidean signature of metric, which suggests that propagation is not possible at all. The propagator would reduce to a delta function in \(CP_2\): the end points \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) would be identical for \(CP_2\) propagation. A second dramatic prediction is that, the condition \(s_1=s_2\) allows for a fixed point \(s_1\) only a discrete set of final points.</li>
        <li>The propagation in H is analog of off-mass shell propagation as off-space-time surface propagation. The notion of induced spinor structure however suggests that it might make sense to speak of propagation along the space-time surface as analog of on-mass-shell propagation.
        The induced Dirac equation in \(X^4\) is analogous to the massless Dirac equation. The condition \(s_1=s_2\) however suggests that this propagation is along light-like geodesics of H, whose projection is a geodesic circle of \(CP_2\). This would give a classical geometric correlate for the fermion propagation even if the space-time propagator might not be needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="how-physical-color" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.1 How do the physical color quantum numbers emerge?</h4>
    <p>It must be taken into account that physical fermions are either color singlets or triplets, not arbitrarily high color partial waves satisfying only the triality condition t=1 for quarks and t=0 for leptons.</p>
    <p>This is achieved in two ways.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Neutrino-antineutrino \(\nu_L\bar{\nu}_R\) pair screens the electroweak charges above weak boson Compton length and could also screen the anomalous parts of color charges.</li>
        <li>The solutions Dirac equation are ground states of conformal representations in which the action of a conformal scaling generator generates higher excitations, which can have color quantum numbers which add to those of color partial waves to give rise to color singlets and triplets.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>p-Adic thermodynamics <a href="#ref-btart-padmass2022">[padmass2022 (btart)]</a> describes the thermodynamics of the scaling generator, and gives excellent predictions for the particle masses so that conformal algebra is involved in any case.</p>
    <p>For the proposed form of the H propagator, the construction of the quantum states separates completely from that for the propagator.</p>

    <h4 id="confinement-scale" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.2 How could the confinement scale emerge?</h4>
    <p>In QCD, confinement occurring on some \(M^4\) scale, the confinement scale, is a fundamental concept. Free quarks are the basic dynamical entities below the confinement scale and transform to hadrons above this scale.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In attempts to understand this, the space-time representation of H propagator \(D_F((m_1,s_1),(m_2,s_2))\) for the massa propagator \(M^4\) degrees of freedom should be used (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Propagator</a>).
        One can consider two options depending on whether the propagation occurs in H or in \(X^4\). What is expected to happen in the case of H propagation, is the following.
            <ol class="list-alpha ml-6">
                <li>At least in short scales when \(a^2=(m_1-m_2)^2\) (a is Minkowski distance is small enough, the propagator is essentially a delta function \(\delta(s_1,s_2)\) in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This would be a phase where the quarks are free and effectively massless. What is remarkable is that the \(s_1=s_2\) condition implies that for a given \(s_1\) there is only a discrete set of points that the propagator can connect! At partonic orbits for which \(CP_2\) projection is fixed the number of these points would be large.</li>
                <li>If the condition \(s_1=s_2\) holds true quite generally, the classical non-determinism of the space-time dynamics implies that the number of points satisfying these conditions is reduced during the time evolution and makes propagation impossible for large values of \(a^2\). This would mean quark confinement. This of course also applies to possible colored excitations of leptons predicted by TGD and for which there is some evidence <a href="#ref-allb-leptc">[leptc (allb)]</a>.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It is reasonable to expect that the p-adic length scale determines the scale at which the confinement occurs. This is where the algebraic geometry of the spacetime surface comes into play.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here holography=holomorphy vision suggests a concrete approach.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>In the holography=holomorphy vision <a href="#ref-btart-Frenkel">[Frenkel, Langlands2025 (btart)]</a>, space-time surfaces corresponds to the roots of polynomial pair \(f=(f_1,f_2): H \rightarrow C^2\) of generalized complex coordinates of H (one hypercomplex coordinate and 3 complex coordinates). They allow as dynamic symmetries the maps \(g=(g_1,g_2): C^2 \rightarrow C^2\) defined as functional compositions \(f \rightarrow g \circ f\).
        One can define prime polynomial pairs f as those which do not allow a decomposition \(f=g \circ h\). The prime polynomial pairs \(g=(g_1,g_2)\) can be defined similarly. The pairs \((g_1,Id)\) are of special interest and in this case the prime polynomials \(g_1(p)\) have prime degree p.</li>
        <li>One should study the H propagator \(D_F((m_1,s_1),(m_2,s_2))\) for the polynomials \(g_p\) and the functional iterates \(g_p^{\circ k} \circ f\). The integration over \(CP_2\) projections of the end points gives a bilocal inner product of the modes. The constraint \(s_1=s_2\) reduces it to an ordinary inner product for the \(CP_2\) spinor modes.
        The number of point pairs satisfying the constraint \(s_1=s_2\) depends on the space-time surface. The functional iterates of \(g_p\) involve classical non-determinism identifiable as p-adic non-determinism <a href="#ref-btart-HHtwistor">[HHtwistor (btart)]</a> so that the number space-time points satisfying the constraint \(s_1=s_2\) decreases as the number k of iteration steps increases. This would make propagation over too long scales impossible. p-Adic length scale could correspond to this scale. Note that very large primes p are involved: for the electron one has \(p=M_{127}=2^{127}-1\).
        The confinement scale can be identified as a p-adic length scale for quarks or hadrons, which is determined by the thermal mass predicted by p-adic thermodynamics. The larger the value of p, the longer the confinement scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Concerning the option based on \(X^4\) propagation two observations can be made.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>The possibly existing \(X^4\) propagator would be the analog of a massless propagator since the Dirac equation for induced spinor fields in \(X^4\) is a generalization of the massless Dirac equation. This notion makes sense also for the lower dimensional surfaces of \(X^4\) and 1-D light-like curves are natural candidates for fermion lines.</li>
        <li>An observation of possible relevance is that the masses of quarks are effectively zero for the propagation along the light-like \(M^4\) geodesics along parton surfaces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="effective-mass-scale" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 scroll-mt-custom">1.1.3 How the effective mass scale of a fermion is determined?</h4>
    <p>There are two basic questions to be answered. Is the p-adic mass scale determined by the spectrum of \(CP_2\) masses or by p-adic thermodynamics? Does the spectrum of \(CP_2\) masses or p-adic thermal masses appear at the level of propagator or only at the level of initial and final states of propagation?</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>A naive assumption would be that the quark and lepton masses appear in the propagator depend on the spectrum of color excitations \(m^2=\lambda_n^2\) for the fermions involved (\(\nu_L\bar{\nu}_R\) for the second option). Several arguments suggest this cannot be the case.
        p-Adic thermodynamics, in which the basic parameters characterizing the particle are the p-adic prime p and the p-adic temperature \(T_p=1/n\), works excellently so that it seems that \(CP_2\) mass spectrum does not make itself visible in the propagator. In p-adic thermodynamics, a large \(p \approx 2^k\), simplifies enormously and something similar can be expected now as well.</li>
        <li>If the propagation takes in H, it is massless for a fixed H chirality so that the eigenvalue spectrum of \(D(CP_2)\) is not visible in propagation. This separation between the structure of states and propagator would be a huge simplification.</li>
        <li>Concerning \(X^4\) propagation, the semiclassical description as light-like H geodesics of the geodesic manifold \(M^4 \times S^1 \subset M^4 \times CP_2\) could be considered as a model. The masslessness of H would no longer imply masslessness in \(M^4\). One could say that p-adic thermal excitations deform the light-like geodesics of \(M^4\) to those of \(M^4 \times S^1 \subset H\). Also this suggests that the masses are not visible in the \(X^4\) propagator as also the fact that they do not appear in the \(X^4\) Dirac operator suggests.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="plan-of-article" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 scroll-mt-custom">1.2 Plan of the article</h3>
    <p>The plan of the article is as follows.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>I have considered several approaches to the calculation of the fermion propagator and in the following I describe the most elegant looking view about the fermion propagation as propagation in H. Assuming a fixed H chirality, the propagator reduces to massless propagator in H and is proportional to delta function in \(CP_2\) so that no propagation occurs in \(CP_2\) degrees of freedom. This has powerful consequences and the existing intuitive picture about fundamental fermion lines as light-like geodesics at partonic 2-surfaces follows. One can also understand color confinement in this picture.</li>
        <li>The 4-D propagation along \(X^4\) involves induced spinor structure and my intuitive feeling is that also this perspective is important, at least as semiclassical model. The condition \(s_1=s_2\) for H propagation suggests that fermion propagation is always 1-dimensional and along a light-like geodesic of H. This would give a very concrete classical view of the propagation even if a 4-D propagator were not useful. In particular, the p-adic thermal massivation could be modelled semi-classically.</li>
        <li>Also the problems related to the origin of p-adicity and interpretational problems of p-adic thermodynamics and to the generalized conformal invariance will be discussed in the Appendix.</li>
